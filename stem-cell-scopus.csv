Methods: This study assessed the in vitro cytotoxic effects of three metallic nanoparticles (Co, Cr and Ti) separately and in combination on macrophages. The in vivo effects were also evaluated after peri-tibial soft tissue injection in mice. Results: The results demonstrated that Co, Cr, and Ti nanoparticles and their combination were phagocytosed by macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. High doses of nanoparticles from each individual metal caused a variable rate of cell death in vitro. However, the mixture of Co/Cr/Ti nanoparticles was more toxic than the Co, Cr or Ti metals alone at low doses. Intracellular distribution of Co, Cr, and Ti in the combined group was heterogeneous and associated with distinct morphological features. The results from in vivo experiments showed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in peri-tibial soft tissue following the administration of Co alone as well as the combination of nanoparticles. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the combination of Co/Cr/Ti nanoparticles was more cytotoxic than any of the individual metals in vitro and induced higher expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines than single metals in vivo. The in vivo model utilised in this study might provide a useful tool for rapid assessment of the effects of unintended release of metal nanoparticles from implants in pre-/post-marketing studies. Translational potential of this article: This study highlights the importance of preclinical assessments of potential nanoparticles produced by wear and tear of metal implants using macrophages and animal models, in particular their combinational toxicity in addition to the assessments of the bulk metallic materials. © 2022 The Authors","chromium; cobalt; cytokine; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; messenger RNA; metal nanoparticle; nanoparticle; pentobarbital; phorbol 12 acetate 13 myristate; titanium; tumor necrosis factor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell culture; centrifugation; cytotoxicity; elemental analysis; endocytosis; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; inflammation; macrophage; male; mouse; nonhuman; optical density; phagocytosis; RAW 264.7 cell line; RNA extraction; scanning electron microscopy; soft tissue; spectrophotometry","Elsevier (Singapore) Pte Ltd",Article,Scopus

This is why for more than 10 years, the European Medicine Agency (EMA) has stated that all drugs to be marketed must be tested on the paediatric population in accordance with the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP). The objective of this study is to make a cross sectional analysis of the information related to the use of cancer drugs authorised on the European market in the paediatric population. Method: The European Public Assessment Reports and PIPs have been considered. The following data were extracted for onco-haematological drugs approved since 2016: paediatric indications, information about the paediatric population in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and presence and characteristics of PIPs. A descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the drugs was made from the point of view of the paediatric population. Results: Forty-eight drugs with onco-haematological indications have been authorised for marketing since 2016, 7 (15%) of these have paediatric indications. Two (4%) drugs have no paediatric indication but have information related to the paediatric population within SmPC. Forty-one (85%) drugs have no reference to the paediatric population in SmPC. Seventeen (35%) drugs out of 48 do not have PIPs and 11 have been granted a waiver to present the results of paediatric studies. The other 19 active ingredients have a total of 28 PIPs. Conclusion and relevance: Most of the onco-haematological drugs approved by EMA since 2016 have neither paediatric indications nor mentions about paediatric use in SmPC. PIPs represent an opportunity, but demand for the paediatric population is still huge. © The Author(s) 2021.","abemaciclib; antineoplastic agent; asparaginase macrogol; atezolizumab; binimetinib; dinutuximab; drug; gemtuzumab ozogamicin; larotrectinib; methotrexate; neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase; new drug; niraparib; orphan drug; palbociclib; tisagenlecleucel T; treosulfan; unclassified drug; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; Article; childhood cancer; clinical practice; cross-sectional study; data analysis; data extraction; drug approval; drug efficacy; drug indication; drug information; drug marketing; drug safety; European Medicines Agency; human; neuroblastoma; Pediatric Investigation Plan; pediatric patient; practice guideline; solid malignant neoplasm; stem cell transplantation; child; Europe; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Approval; Europe; Humans","SAGE Publications Ltd",Article,Scopus

Since MSCs' mechanism of action in humans is not well defined, more than a single functional property of MSCs needs to be captured as a surrogate measure of potency utilizing assay matrix technologies. However, the current limitation is the sole investigation of MSC-mediated T-cell suppression as a surrogate measure of potency. We investigated the effect of MSCs on B-cell matrix responses to be incorporated into the assay matrix potency analytical system. Our results demonstrate that MSCs inhibit B-cell differentiation and block pan-antibody secretion upon activation of B cells in the PBMCs. In contrast, MSCs are inferior in blocking B-cell matrix responses when purified B cells are used. Mechanistic analysis has demonstrated that MSC-mediated inhibition of B-cell matrix responses is non-contact dependent and Tryptophan metabolic pathway plays a major role, akin to the mechanism of MSC-mediated T-cell suppression. MSCs also inhibit both T-cell and B-cell responses when both of these lymphoid populations are concurrently activated in the PBMCs. Secretome analysis of MSC and T/B cell-activated PBMC cocultures identified direct and inverse correlative matrix signatures between humoral antibody isotypes and secretory molecules. The current analysis of the combined and concomitant investigation of T-cell and B-cell matrix responses fulfills the potency assay matrix strategy by incorporating MSCs' interaction with more than a single inflammatory immune responder. © The Author(s) 2022.

This study aimed to characterize the safety profiles and differences in IMiDs through a disproportionality analysis using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), a post-marketing surveillance database. Methods: This study filtered reports of thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide as primary suspect drugs in FAERS files from January 2013 to December 2021. AEs in the reports were retrieved according to the preferred terms (PTs) of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Furthermore, we detected safety signals using the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), and Bayesian belief propagation neural network (BCPNN). When all three algorithms showed an association between the target drug and the AE, a positive signal was generated. Results: We extracted 9,968 thalidomide, 231,926 lenalidomide, and 55,066 pomalidomide AE reports. AEs were more common in male patients and in those >44 years old. Important safety signals were detected based on the system organ classes (SOC), including thalidomide (cardiac disorders: ROR, 2.87; PRR, 2.79; IC 1.22), lenalidomide (gastrointestinal disorders: ROR, 2.38; PRR, 2.27; IC 0.75), and pomalidomide (respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: ROR, 2.14; PRR, 2.09; IC 0.85). Within the PT level, we identified novel risk signals: the thalidomide-induced second primary malignancy (SPM) signal was significant; lenalidomide reduced the success rate of hematopoietic stem cell collection; and three IMiDs may cause human chorionic gonadotropin increase, but this needs to be proven by clinical data. Pneumonia, sepsis, and renal failure are common risk factors for death due to IMiDs. Compared with thalidomide and lenalidomide, pomalidomide has a lower risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is beneficial to patients with renal insufficiency. Conclusion: Mining data from FAERS resulted in novel AE signals, including adenocarcinoma of colon, harvest failure of blood stem cells, and increased levels of human chorionic gonadotropin. Further investigation is required to verify the significance of these signals. Moreover, IMiDs showed differences in safety reports, which should be emphasized by clinicians.

Research has shown promising results and opened an avenue of great importance for patients who currently lack a disease modifying therapy. The use of hESC has given rise to moral concerns and been the focus of often heated debates on the moral status of human embryos. Approval for marketing is still pending. Objective: To Investigate the perspectives and concerns of patients with PD, patients being the directly concerned stakeholders in the ethical discussion. Methods: Qualitative semi-structured interviews related to this new therapy in seventeen patients from two Swedish cities. Results: The participants expressed various interests related to the use of human embryos for development of medicinal therapies; however, overall, they were positive towards the use of hESC for treatment of PD. It was deemed important that the donating woman or couple made the choice to donate embryos voluntarily. Furthermore, there were concerns that the industry does not always prioritise the patient over profit; thus, transparency was seen as important. © 2022, The Author(s).","female; human; human embryonic stem cell; mammalian embryo; Parkinson disease; qualitative research; Embryo, Mammalian; Female; Human Embryonic Stem Cells; Humans; Parkinson Disease; Qualitative Research","BioMed Central Ltd",Article,Scopus

These developments include the increased availability of effective and safe generic imatinib at affordable prices, studies showing that doses of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) lower than the approved dose are effective and less toxic, studies showing that dose-adjusted ponatinib therapy at a reduced dose is effective and substantially safer than approved doses, and the approval of asciminib as third-line therapy in 2021. With the availability of an affordable generic imatinib, all patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia globally should be able to access a lifetime supply. The availability of reduced-dose schedules of generic second-generation TKIs, which are less toxic and produce faster deep molecular response than imatinib, might make them more appealing to use as front-line therapy. In the subsequent-line setting, the role of different TKIs as second, third, and later lines of therapy depends on the evolving front-line use. Dose-adjusted ponatinib schedules have shown better efficacy and safety with long-term follow-up. Ponatinib is the favoured therapy for patients with second-generation-TKI resistance or chronic myeloid leukaemia with 944C→T (Thr315Ile)-mutated BCR-ABL1. Studies of asciminib are needed in larger numbers of patients and with longer follow-up than has been done previously to better assess its comparative efficacy, safety, and survival data (vs ponatinib). The role of third-generation TKIs as second-line therapy following front-line resistance to second-generation TKIs needs to be evaluated. New and mature data with TKI therapy in chronic myeloid leukaemia are producing observations that encourage continuous discussion of the optimal treatment recommendations and frameworks in chronic myeloid leukaemia. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","asciminib; BCR ABL protein; bosutinib; dasatinib; generic drug; imatinib; nilotinib; ponatinib; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; antineoplastic agent; BCR ABL protein; generic drug; imatinib; protein kinase inhibitor; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; bone marrow suppression; chronic myeloid leukemia; deep vein thrombosis; drug approval; drug bioavailability; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug marketing; drug safety; follow up; high income country; hospital readmission; human; hypertension; off label drug use; overall survival; pancreatitis; pleura effusion; polymerase chain reaction; postmarketing surveillance; progression free survival; pulmonary hypertension; randomized controlled trial (topic); rash; Review; United States; genetics; marketing; Antineoplastic Agents; Drugs, Generic; Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl; Humans; Imatinib Mesylate; Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive; Marketing; Protein Kinase Inhibitors","Elsevier Ltd",Review,Scopus

Treatment schedule optimization aims to reduce the frequency of hospital visits and decrease treatment burden and healthcare utilization. MINDway (NCT05222555) will investigate if tafasitamab administration at levels higher than the approved 12 mg/kg dose at a reduced dosing frequency maintains the benefit–risk relationship of tafasitamab + lenalidomide for patients with R/R DLBCL. Objective: To assess an optimized tafasitamab treatment schedule in patients with R/R DLBCL. Design: Open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib/II study. Setting: Currently enrolling; the planned sample size is 51 patients. Patients: Eligible patients are aged 18–80 years with histologically confirmed R/R DLBCL and 1–3 prior systemic regimens, including CD20-targeted therapy. Patients previously treated with CD19-targeted therapy or immunomodulatory imide drugs, such as lenalidomide, are excluded. Interventions: The modified dosing regimen will be investigated in a stepwise design: two sequential dose-finding cohorts (planned n=6 each) followed by an expansion cohort (planned n=39). Lenalidomide 25 mg will be administered in all cohorts on Days 1–21 of each 28-day cycle for up to 12 cycles. After Cycle 12, patients will continue tafasitamab monotherapy at the assigned dosing regimen until progression. After reviewing safety and pharmacokinetic data from Cohorts 1 and 2, patients will be enrolled in an expansion cohort to receive tafasitamab + lenalidomide (tafasitamab dose: 24 or 30 mg/kg) for further evaluation. No intra-patient dose escalation from 24 to 30 mg/kg is permitted. Main Outcome Measures: The primary endpoints are the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events. Key secondary endpoints are tafasitamab serum concentration after 3 and 12 cycles, best objective response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival. Results: Not yet available. Conclusions: MINDway will evaluate an optimized tafasitamab dosing regimen to reduce the frequency of hospital/clinic visits for tafasitamab-treated patients with R/R DLBCL. Reducing the frequency of visits by half is expected to reduce patient burden and support long-term treatment compliance. Fewer visits may result in less exposure to hospital infections in this already susceptible population.

The primary analysis of First-MIND (NCT04134936) demonstrated that adding tafasitamab + LEN does not impair dosing and scheduling of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), and toxicities were similar to those expected with R-CHOP alone (ASH 2021; #3556). Objective: frontMIND (NCT04824092) will investigate the efficacy and safety of R-CHOP + tafasitamab + LEN versus R-CHOP alone in previously untreated patients with high-intermediate and high-risk DLBCL. Design: A Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Setting: Approximately 350 centers from the Americas, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients: Eligible patients (n=880) will be aged 18–80 years with previously untreated local biopsy-proven, CD20-positive DLBCL, International Prognostic Index (IPI) score 3–5 (age-adjusted IPI 2–3 if ≤60 years), and ECOG performance score 0–2. Patients with transformed lymphoma are excluded. Interventions: Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive six 21-day cycles of either R-CHOP + tafasitamab (12 mg/kg intravenously, Days 1, 8, and 15) + LEN (25 mg orally, Days 1–10) or R-CHOP + tafasitamab + LEN placebos. Main Outcome Measures: The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed progression-free survival; secondary endpoints include event-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Minimal residual disease parameters will also be investigated. Results: Results for this study are not yet available. Conclusions: There remains a high unmet need to improve treatment options for newly diagnosed patients with high-intermediate and high-risk DLBCL. The combination of tafasitamab + LEN + R-CHOP may have synergistic potential. Preliminary data from the First-MIND study suggest that tafasitamab ± LEN + R-CHOP may be tolerable in patients with treatment-naïve DLBCL. frontMIND will provide further evaluation of clinical benefits and safety in patients with newly diagnosed high-intermediate and high-risk DLBCL.

Methods: Data sources: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases (up to Jan 2022) were searched to identify English articles. Search terms included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, herpes zoster, RZV, ZVL. Study Selection: Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vaccine efficacy and safety and observational studies assessing vaccine effectiveness (after a vaccine was approved for marketing) were included. Data Extraction: Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data, and checked the each other results. Results: Seventeen RCTs and 19 cohort studies were included. Among immunocompetent subjects, RZV was superior to ZVL at wide intervals (relative vaccine efficacy: 84%, 95% CI: 53%–95%; relative vaccine effectiveness: 49%, 95% CI: 21%–67%), across genders and subjects aged ≥ 60 years. Among immunocompromised subjects, RZV was superior to placebo in terms of vaccine efficacy (60%, 95% CI: 49%–69%). There was no difference between ZVL and placebo in those with selected immunosuppressive conditions. RZV was 45% (95% CI: 30%–59%) superior to ZVL in real-world practice. Compared with placebo, adverse events related to RZV were primarily related to injection-site and systemic, and RZV did not increase the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) or death. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between groups with and without immunosuppression.

Methods: This article briefly introduced the regulatory framework development, the progress in stem cell clinical researches and clinical trials of commercially developed stem cell-based products, as well as the clinical review concerns of stem cell-based products in China. Main findings: The current regulatory framework of stem cell clinical researches in China was launched in 2015, when regulatory authorities issued “Administrative Measures on Stem Cell Clinical Research” (AMSCCR) detailing the rules of stem cell clinical research. Thereafter, the rapidly growing stem cell clinical researches were rigorously managed and clinical use of stem cell therapy was halted. Meanwhile, commercially developed stem cell-based products are supervised by Drug Administration Law (DAL). Conclusion: The regulatory framework of stem cell-based therapy in China has progressed in the last few decades, which is currently regulated according to AMSCCR and DAL. Well-designed and patient-focused clinical trial is required for commercially developed stem cell-based products, and definite clinical benefit evidence is crucial to obtain marketing authorization. © 2022 The Authors.

OA is a major contributor to pain, loss of function, and reduced quality of life. Over the last decade, considerable research efforts have focused on cell-based therapies, including several stem cell-derived approaches to reverse the cartilage alterations associated with OA. Although several tissue sources for deriving cell-based therapies have been identified, none of the resident stem cell populations have adequately fulfilled the promise of curing OA. Indeed, many cell products do not contain true stem cells. As well, issues with aggressive marketing efforts, combined with a lack of evidence regarding efficacy, lead the several national regulatory bodies to discontinue the use of stem cell therapy for OA until more robust evidence becomes available. A review of the evidence is timely to address the status of cell-based cartilage regeneration. The promise of stem cell therapy is not new and has been used successfully to treat non-arthritic diseases, such as hematopoietic and muscle disorders. These fields of regenerative therapy have the advantage of a considerable foundation of knowledge in the area of stem cell repair mechanisms, the role of the stem cell niche, and niche-supporting cells. This foundation is lacking in the field of cartilage repair. So, where should we look for the ideal stem cell to regenerate cartilage? It has recently been discovered that cartilage itself may contain a population of SC-like progenitors. Other potential tissues include stem cell-rich dental pulp and the adolescent growth plate, the latter of which contains chondrocyte progenitors essential for producing the cartilage scaffold needed for bone growth. In this article, we review the progress on stem cell therapies for arthritic disorders, focusing on the various stem cell populations previously used for cartilage regeneration, successful cases of stem cell therapies in muscle and hemopoietic disorders, some of the reasons why these other fields have been successful (i.e., “lessons learned” to be applied to OA stem cell therapy), and finally, novel potential sources of stem cells for regenerating damaged cartilage in vivo.

The present study aims to assess the quality, accuracy, and readability of online educational resources available to patients regarding biologic therapies for shoulder pathology. Methods: Eight search terms relevant to shoulder biologic therapies (shoulder + BMAC, Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate, PRP, Platelet Rich Plasma, Lipogems, Adipose Tissue, Biologic therapy, and Stem cell therapy) were searched across three separate search engines. The first 25 websites of each search were recorded. Duplicate websites and those not specific to shoulder pathology were excluded. Three evaluators independently assessed quality using an author-derived scoring rubric for a total of 25 possible points and accuracy for a total of 12 possible points. The Flesch-Kincaid readability test was used to quantify reading levels. Websites were further characterized by authorship and the presence of commercial bias. Results: Of the 600 results from the initial search, 59 met inclusion criteria. The mean quality of the websites was poor, with 7.97 ± 2.3 of 25 points (32%). The mean accuracy was low, with 8.47 ± 1.52 of 12 points (71%). The average reading level was 11.2 ± 1.93, with 32% of websites' reading at greater than 12th grade reading level. The search terms of “shoulder PRP” and “shoulder Platelet Rich Plasma” yielded the highest quality results (mean = 8.14 ± 2.63). “shoulder Lipogems” and “shoulder Adipose tissue” yielded the most accurate results (mean = 9.25 ± 0.96). “shoulder BMAC” and “shoulder bone marrow aspirate concentrate” were most difficult to read (mean = 12.54 ± 3.73). Sixty-four percent of websites were authored by physicians, hospitals, or medical groups. The accuracy of websites authored by health care professionals was significantly higher than the accuracy of those authored by other industry sources (P = .01). Fifteen percent of websites demonstrated commercial bias. Discussion: The online resources available to patients seeking information about biologic therapies for the treatment of shoulder pathologies are of very poor quality, moderately poor accuracy, and advanced readability. Providers should caution patients about the reliability of direct-to-consumer biologic marketing for shoulder pathology.

In South Africa, access to these novel gene therapies and cell and tissue-based products is limited. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) diversity and a paucity of suitable HLA-identical unrelated donors, results in limited access to haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell transplantation (HSPCT). Cell-based products could increase this access. Genetic diversity can also manifest in local or region-specific rare congenital disorders, and in vivo gene therapies hold the promise of developing treatments and cures for these debilitating disorders. South Africa has a disproportionate mortality rate due to non-natural causes, with many surviving with permanent injuries and disabilities. Tissue-engineered cell-based products have the potential to restore many of those affected and improve quality of life and productivity. These factors create an urgency for South Africa to develop regenerative medicines to address the country's unique needs and to provide access to these new and innovative treatment modalities. Achieving this objective requires a well-coordinated effort by multiple stakeholders and role players. A critical component of a regenerative medicine ecosystem is establishing an enabling regulatory framework for these new classes of medicines. Here we provide a brief profile of South Africa, including its genetic diversity, economy, the impact of the burden of disease, health policy and the healthcare system.

Further, the introduction of such treatments has improved survival and converted a terminal disease into a more manageable condition. However, many clinical, ethical, and regulatory issues are raised with such novel additions.

Several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved and are widely used to stem the recurring waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Post-marketing surveillance is essential to record even rare safety issues related to these new vaccines. Among these issues, several autoimmune phenomena have been recorded in temporal association with and feasibly triggered by a vaccination. Acquired haemophilia A (AHA) is a rare condition characterized by new-onset haemorrhagic diathesis caused by an inhibitor of blood clotting factor VIII (FVIII), often in the elderly and most commonly associated with autoimmune or malignant disease. There have been a small number of AHA cases triggered by vaccinations, including those against SARS-CoV-2. We report the first case of AHA in temporal association with an mRNA-1273 booster vaccination. The diagnosis was made promptly, and the patient received appropriate care including immunosuppression using glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide (CYC) and rituximab (RTX). The haemorrhage ceased after escalation of treatment, and the patient is recovering. Concurrent malignancy was initially ruled out using a wide scope of diagnostic tests, but pleomorphic dermal sarcoma (PDS) of the forehead occurred after initiation of specific AHA immunosuppressive treatment. Since large vaccination programs are ongoing worldwide and potential adverse events during post-marketing surveillance have been reported following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, this case illustrates challenges in rare events occurring in association with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and to proof a causal relationship.

These cells are widely used in basic and clinical research to treat several human diseases and medically relevant conditions. Although there are promising results, only a few treatments are approved of its administration, and clinicians should not underestimate the potential risks of its application without proper authorization. However, some treatments advertised mainly through the internet are not supported by solid or rigorous scientific evidence, legal consent, or the assurance of safety and efficacy, especially in the cell therapy tourism space. This practice allows patients to travel from stringently regulated countries to less restricted ones and increase the flourishing of nonendorsed therapies in these regions. Clinical applications of MSC-based treatments are subject to health legislation, and regulatory agencies are responsible for supervising their manufacture, quality control, and marketing approval. Consensus is needed to homologize and strengthen health legislation regarding those therapies, particularly in regions where medical tourism is frequent. Latin America and the Caribbean, an overlooked region with very heterogeneous legislation regarding cell therapy, is a popular medical tourism destination. Brazil and Argentina created regulations to supervise cell-based treatment manufacture, quality, and marketing, while Mexico, considered the second-largest drug market in Latin America, does not recognize nor authorize any cell as therapy. Also, some regulatory bodies miss the importance of several critical good manufacture practice processes to ensure reproducible, reliable, safe, and potentially more favorable results and do not consider them in their legislation. These inconsistencies make the region vulnerable to unproven or unethical treatments, potentially becoming a public health problem involving people from countries worldwide. This review attempts to generate awareness for the legal status of cell therapies in Latin America and the need for standardization as this region is a significant medical tourism destination. © Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.","bioethics; Chile; Colombia; Costa Rica; Dominican Republic; Ecuador; health legislation; human; international cooperation; medical tourism; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; Panama; Peru; Review; South and Central America; standardization; Uruguay; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; mesenchymal stem cell; South and Central America; standard; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Latin America; Medical Tourism; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Reference Standards","Mary Ann Liebert Inc.",Review,Scopus

Currently, there are only three SC therapies with marketing authorization within the European Union. To optimize outcomes, it is important to understand the biodistribution and behavior of transplanted SCs in vivo. A variety of imaging agents have been developed to trace SCs; however, they mostly lack the ability to simultaneously monitor the SC function and biodistribution at high resolutions. Here, we report the synthesis and application of a nanoparticle (NP) construct consisting of a gold NP core coated with rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC)-doped mesoporous silica (AuMS). The MS layer further contained a thiol-modified internal surface and an amine-modified external surface for dye conjugation. Highly fluorescent AuMS of three different sizes were successfully synthesized. The NPs were non-Toxic and efficiently taken up by limbal epithelial SCs (LESCs). We further showed that we can functionalize AuMS with a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive fluorescent dye using two methods, loading the probe into the mesopores, with or without additional capping by a lipid bilayer, and by covalent attachment to surface and/or mesoporous-functionalized thiol groups. All four formulations displayed a ROS concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence. Further, in an ex vivo SC transplantation model, a combination of optical coherence tomography and fluorescence microscopy was used to synergistically identify AuMS-labeled LESC distribution at micrometer resolution. Our AuMS constructs allow for multimodal imaging and simultaneous ROS sensing of SCs and represent a promising tool for in vivo SC tracing. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Specifically, cardiovascular developments have been showing amongst the lowest levels of approvals. In addition, concerns over the adverse effects of drugs to the cardiovascular system have been increasing and resulting in failure at the preclinical level as well as withdrawal of drugs post-marketing. Besides factors such as the increased cost of clinical trials and increases in the requirements and the complexity of the regulatory processes, there is also a gap between the currently existing pre-clinical screening methods and the clinical studies in humans. This gap is mainly caused by the lack of complexity in the currently used 2D cell culture-based screening systems, which do not accurately reflect human physiological conditions. Cell-based drug screening is widely accepted and extensively used and can provide an initial indication of the drugs' therapeutic efficacy and potential cytotoxicity. However, in vitro cell-based evaluation could in many instances provide contradictory findings to the in vivo testing in animal models and clinical trials. This drawback is related to the failure of these 2D cell culture systems to recapitulate the human physiological microenvironment in which the cells reside. In the body, cells reside within a complex physiological setting, where they interact with and respond to neighboring cells, extracellular matrix, mechanical stress, blood shear stress, and many other factors. These factors in sum affect the cellular response and the specific pathways that regulate variable vital functions such as proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Although pre-clinical in vivo animal models provide this level of complexity, cross species differences can also cause contradictory results from that seen when the drug enters clinical trials. Thus, there is a need to better mimic human physiological conditions in pre-clinical studies to improve the efficiency of drug screening. A novel approach is to develop 3D tissue engineered miniaturized constructs in vitro that are based on human cells. In this review, we discuss the factors that should be considered to produce a successful vascular construct that is derived from human cells and is both reliable and reproducible.

Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of plerixafor in Japanese patients undergoing A-SCT for various indications in real-world practice. Patients and Methods: This post-marketing surveillance study included Japanese patients initiating PBSC mobilization with plerixafor for A-SCT. Safety assessments included the incidence of adverse events (AEs) including serious AEs, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and laboratory variables. Effectiveness assessments were the proportion of patients with the target CD34+ cell yield (≥2 × 106 cells/kg) ≤4 days after plerixafor administration and the number of days required to reach the target CD34+ cell yield. Results: In total, 785 patients were registered, and the safety and effectiveness analysis sets comprised 764 and 717 patients, respectively. ADRs occurred in 12.2% of patients, with gastrointestinal disorders (5.5%), laboratory investigations (4.5%), and blood and lymphatic system disorders (3.0%) being the most common. A total of 71.1% of patients had the target CD34+ cell yield within ≤4 days of treatment, with a mean (standard deviation) of 1.3 (0.7) days to reach the target CD34+ cell yield. Over 80% of patients with a baseline CD34+ cell count &gt;2 cells/μL had a target CD34+ cell yield within ≤4 days of treatment. Conclusions: This large post-marketing surveillance study provided real-world evidence detailing the safety and effectiveness of plerixafor for PBSC mobilization in Japanese patients undergoing A-SCT. Importantly, no new safety concerns were identified, and the safety profile of plerixafor was consistent with the established profile of this drug. © 2021, The Author(s).","alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; C reactive protein; CD34 antigen; gamma glutamyltransferase; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; lactate dehydrogenase; loperamide; plerixafor; uric acid; acute heart infarction; adolescent; adult; aged; AL amyloidosis; apheresis; Article; autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation; backache; body weight; causality; child; creatinine clearance; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug safety; ECOG Performance Status; female; gastrointestinal disease; hematologic malignancy; Hodgkin disease; human; hypersensitivity; interstitial lung disease; Japanese (people); leukocyte count; leukocytosis; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; mild renal impairment; multicenter study; multiple myeloma; nausea and vomiting; neutrophil count; nonhodgkin lymphoma; observational study; phase 4 clinical trial; platelet count; postmarketing surveillance; splenomegaly; stem cell mobilization; thrombocytopenia","Adis",Article,Scopus

Currently, multiple targeted therapies are available to treat patients augmenting the arsenal of modalities which also includes chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCST) and chimeric antigen T-cell therapy (CAR-T). These novel, targeted agents have dramatically increased optimism for patients, who may now be treated over many years with successive regimens. As fortunate as we are to have these new therapies available for our patients, this advantage is juxtaposed with the challenges involved with delivering them safely. While each class of agents has demonstrated efficacy, in terms of response rates and survival, they also exert class effects which pose risks for toxicity. In addition, newer generation agents within the classes often have slightly different toxicity profiles than did their predecessors. These factors must be addressed, and their risks mitigated by the multidisciplinary team. This review presents a summary of the evolution of drug development for MM. For each targeted agent, the efficacy data from pivotal trials and highlights of the risks that were demonstrated in trials, as well as during post-marketing surveillance, are presented. Specific risks associated with agents within the classes, that are not shared with all new class members, are described.

This remarkable achievement was underlined by the marketing approval of CAR T cell therapies in 2017 in the United States, followed by many other countries, world-wide. Since then, thousands of patients have benefited from this autologous, gene modified cell therapy (Abou-El-Enein et al., 2021). Rare diseases, particularly innate neurological diseases such as Huntington's disease have also been a target for cell therapies. The notion of being able to augment or replace the function of diseased neurons with progenitor cells or neurons derived from human stem cells has been researched for the last 10 years and is finally reaching the stage of clinical translation (Holley et al., 2018; Reidling et al., 2018). With these cellular and gene therapies reaching clinical applicability, it is important to bring them to patients in a safe, efficacious and reliable way, and for this purpose, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) needs to be applied to the manufacturing of such novel and often life-saving therapies. In the first decade of the 21st century, gene therapies, particularly in vivo adenoviral vector gene therapy (Wilson, 2009) and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapies (Hacein-Bey-Abina et al., 2008) were associated with adverse events that were highly publicized and gave the field a bad reputation in the public eye. The last two decades, however, due to the meticulous work of dedicated researchers, and excellent progress in GMP manufacturing, cell and gene therapies have become safe and efficacious and have propelled the field to the forefront of the most promising novel therapies available for current unmet medical needs. This book chapter will discuss the historical perspective of cellular therapies and their development, will describe the currently available cell and gene therapies for different diseases and their GMP manufacturing methods and challenges, and will point out the future direction of these therapies and their envisioned manufacturing, as can be foreseen currently. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","biological therapy; gene therapy; human; United States; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Genetic Therapy; Humans; United States","Academic Press Inc.",Book Chapter,Scopus

This study reviewed post-marketing requirement (PMR) and post-marketing commitment (PMC) obligations for oncology drugs approved by the FDA post-Cures Act to identify those with RWE components. Methods: Approval letters issued by the FDA between 2017–2020 for oncology drugs were systematically analyzed for PMRs or PMCs with requests for RWE. For each PMR/PMC identified, the characteristics of the approvals, the PMRs/PMCs, and the RWE requested were reviewed. Results: Of 189 oncology drug approvals with 456 associated PMRs/PMCs, a total of 15 PMRs/PMCs specified RWE. Compared with all oncology drug approvals, the 14 approvals with PMRs/PMCs requesting RWE were more frequently accelerated approvals, for new therapies, with orphan indications. All 15 PMRs/PMCs requested real-world safety data, with 3 also requesting real-world effectiveness data. RWE requested included post-marketing safety reports, prospective observational studies, expanded access study data, and registry data.

Twelve patients (66.7%) achieved a CD34+ cell count ≥2 × 106 cells/kg within 4 days after the start of plerixafor administration. Conclusions: The results provide an encouraging sign that plerixafor 0.24 mg/kg may be safe and effective in pediatric patients in routine clinical practice in Japan, but further research in larger studies is needed. © 2022 The Authors.

For patients with ALS rehabilitation is important to maintain functional independence, ensure safety and optimize quality of life but is not curative. Stem cell therapy (SCT) provides a new approach to treat previously incurable diseases although peer reviewed published evidence has shown no benefit in ALS for slowing disease progression or functional loss. This case report presents a patient with ALS who underwent SCT but deteriorated rapidly after the procedure. Whether the deterioration was due to the natural progress of the disease or expedited by SCT remains unknown. The ethical considerations of how marketing influences healthcare and individuals' decisions in desperate situations along with reasons for taking desperate measures are discussed. Patient education and open communication with ALS patients are imperative in gaining patient satisfaction and overcoming ill effects that marketing could have on unconventional methods of intervention. Raising awareness about the availability and access to multidisciplinary care, the timing of decisions with regards to symptom management and end of life care have proven to enhance the quality of life for such patients. © 2022 Hassan AA et al.","ADL disability; adult; aerobic exercise; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Arab; arm weakness; Article; case report; clinical article; death; deltoid muscle; deterioration; Dynamic Gait Index; embryonic stem cell; falling; fasciculation; fatigue; Functional Independence Measure; human; limited mobility; male; middle aged; muscle atrophy; muscle spasm; pectoral muscle; physiotherapy; plyometrics; resistance training; shuffling gait; stem cell transplantation; Ukraine; adverse event; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; biological therapy; quality of life; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Humans; Quality of Life","F1000 Research Ltd",Article,Scopus

Current development has provided novel treatment approaches to disorders without available treatment. However, the regulatory procedures to allow for access to these therapies is challenging, as is the ability to provide wide access to increasingly expensive therapies. By 2035, these challenges are likely to have accelerated and have the potential to create bottlenecks in drug approval and reduced access to patients. Innovative regulatory and payer solutions are required. In addition, ethical considerations around genetic therapies should be considered in current and future development.

A growing number of clinical trials have indicated that OVs have an excellent safety profile and provide some degree of efficacy, but to date only a single OV drug, HSV-1 talimogene laherparepvec (T-Vec), has achieved marketing approval in the US and Europe. An important issue to consider in order to accelerate the clinical advancement of OV agents is the development of an effective delivery system. Currently, the most commonly employed OV delivery route is intratumoral; however, to target metastatic diseases and tumors that cannot be directly accessed, it is of great interest to develop effective approaches for the systemic delivery of OVs, such as the use of carrier cells. In general, the ideal carrier cell should have a tropism towards the tumor microenvironment (TME), and it must be susceptible to OV infection but remain viable long enough to allow migration and finally release of the OV within the tumor bed. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been heavily investigated as carrier cells due to their inherent tumor tropism, in spite of some disadvantages in biodistribution. This review focuses on the other promising candidate carrier cells under development and discusses their interaction with specific OVs and future research lines. © 2021 by the authors.

The interim PMS data for 461 patients collected as of March 2021 are reported in this publication. Methods: The case report forms (CRFs) were drafted in part by the Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (JDCHCT) using data elements in the Transplant Registry Unified Management Program (TRUMP) and sent to individual HSCT centers to decrease burden of reporting. These CRFs were completed by physicians in the respective HSCT centers and sent to MSD K.K., Tokyo, Japan. Results: Allo-HSCT recipients prescribed with letermovir for CMV prophylaxis were included across 136 centers in Japan between May 2018 and March 2021. Safety and effectiveness were assessed for 460 and 373 patients, respectively. Of the patients in the safety analysis, 13.9 % experienced adverse drug reactions, the most frequent of which were renal impairment (2.2 %) and nausea (1.7 %). Among patients in the effectiveness analysis, the overall CMV antigen positivity rate was 21.2 % at Week 14 and 37.5 % at Week 24 after allo-HSCT. Conclusions: Interim data from this largest of real-world studies confirm the safety and effectiveness of letermovir for CMV prophylaxis in Japanese allo-HSCT recipients. Given the limited data on Asian patients for letermovir use, this survey will provide valuable information for medical decision-making in routine clinical practice, serving as a vital supplement to the results obtained from clinical trials. © 2021, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA and its affiliates.","alemtuzumab; creatinine; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporine; letermovir; methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; steroid; tacrolimus; thymocyte antibody; acetic acid; antivirus agent; letermovir; quinazoline derivative; acute graft versus host disease; acute heart failure; acute heart infarction; acute kidney failure; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; adolescent; adult; aged; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; ascites; atrial fibrillation; child; chronic graft versus host disease; chronic kidney failure; clinical assessment; clinical trial; congestive heart failure; creatinine blood level; cytomegalovirus infection; developmental toxicity; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; graft versus host reaction; heart disease; heart failure; heart ventricle fibrillation; heart ventricle tachycardia; hemorrhagic cystitis; hepatitis; human; interstitial nephritis; Japan; kidney failure; length of stay; liver disease; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; myelodysplastic syndrome; nausea; pericardial effusion; pericarditis; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; postmarketing surveillance; preemptive therapy; reproductive toxicity; side effect; treatment duration; variant angina pectoris; adverse event; cytomegalovirus infection; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; postmarketing surveillance; Acetates; Antiviral Agents; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Japan; Product Surveillance, Postmarketing; Quinazolines","Adis",Article,Scopus

This cell layer is also an ideal target for cell-based therapies. Several early phase clinical trials evaluating cell therapy approaches for diseases involving the RPE, such as age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt's macular dystrophy have been published. However, there have also been numerous reports of complications from unproven “cell therapy” treatments marketed by “cell therapy” clinics. This review aims to outline the particular approaches in the different published clinical trials for cell-based therapies for retinal diseases. Additionally, the controversies surrounding experimental treatments offered outside of legitimate studies are presented. Main body: Cell-based therapies can be applied to disorders that involve the RPE via a variety of techniques. A defining characteristic of any cell therapy treatment is the cell source used: human embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and human umbilical tissue-derived cells have all been studied in published trials. In addition to the cell source, various trials have evaluated particular immunosuppression regiments, surgical approaches, and outcome measures. Data from early phase studies investigating cell-based therapies in non-neovascular age-related macular degeneration (70 patients, five trials), neovascular age-related macular degeneration (12 patients, four trials), and Stargardt’s macular dystrophy (23 patients, three trials) have demonstrated safety related to the cell therapies, though evidence of significant efficacy has not been reported. This is in contrast to the multiple reports of serious complications and permanent vision loss in patients treated at “cell therapy” clinics. These interventions are marketed directly to patients, funded by the patient, lack Food and Drug Administration approval, and lack significant oversight. Conclusion: Currently, there are no proven effective cell-based treatments for retinal diseases, although several trials have investigated potential therapies. These studies reported favorable safety profiles with multiple surgical approaches, with cells derived from multiple sources, and with utilized different immunosuppressive regiments. However, data demonstrating the efficacy and long-term safety are still pending. Nevertheless, “cell therapy” clinics continue to conduct direct-to consumer marketing for non-FDA-approved treatments with potentially blinding complications. © 2021, The Author(s).","bevacizumab; mycophenolate mofetil; prednisone; tacrolimus; adipose derived stem cell; age related macular degeneration; cell differentiation; cell division; cell therapy; clinical effectiveness; drug efficacy; electroretinography; embryonic stem cell; graft rejection; human; induced pluripotent stem cell; optical coherence tomography; pars plana vitrectomy; patient safety; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); prevalence; randomized controlled trial (topic); retina disease; Review; Stargardt disease; treatment outcome; visual acuity; visual impairment; biological therapy; macular degeneration; retina degeneration; retinal pigment epithelium; stem cell transplantation; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Retinal Degeneration; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; Stem Cell Transplantation","BioMed Central Ltd",Review,Scopus

Lipografting has also been credited to reduce age-related skin changes due to the regenerative potential of adipose derived stem cells. Cell-mediated therapies in plastic surgery are rapidly evolving with growing applications. Nanofat, a bio-regenerative liquid suspension rich in stromal vascular fraction cells without viable adipocytes, has been described as an efficient cutaneous anti-aging therapy. We have published in 2013 a review entitled “stem cell facelift: between reality and fiction.” Available clinical evidence at that time did not substantiate marketing and promotional claims of ""stem cell facelift"". The same year, the report about nanofat was published demonstrating striking clinical outcome. The current literature search is aimed at reviewing any evidence that has emerged since then regarding clinical efficacy of this modality. Methods: A thorough PICO tool-based comprehensive literature search of PubMed database for “the efficacy of nanofat cell-mediated anti-aging therapy” was conducted with a time frame from 2013 till present. Results: Despite apparent increasing popularity of stem cell rejuvenation, well-controlled clinical studies about this modality are surprisingly very scarce. Only seven papers published after 2013 were identified and were included in this review Conclusion: Though considered to be a safe procedure, and despite documented histologic improvement and striking clinical outcome in some reports, available evidence can hardly support clinical improvement of skin quality. Before cell-mediated aesthetic rejuvenation applications can be routinely undertaken, more robust evidence with well-defined primary outcome end points and objective outcome measures is required.

This has led to a market ripe for stem cell tourism, with Tijuana, Mexico, as a major destination. In this study, we characterize the online marketing, intervention details, pricing of services, and assess potential safety risks through web surveillance of regenerative medicine clinics marketing services in Tijuana. Methods: We conducted structured online search queries from March to April 2019 using 296 search terms in English and Spanish on two search engines (Google and Bing) to identify websites engaged in direct-to-consumer advertising of regenerative medicine services. We performed content analysis to characterize three categories of interest: online presence, tokens of scientific legitimacy, and intervention details. Results: Our structured online searches resulted in 110 unique websites located in Tijuana corresponding to 76 confirmed locations. These clinics’ online presence consisted of direct-to-consumer advertising mainly through a dedicated website (94.5%) or Facebook page (65.5%). The vast majority of these websites (99.1%) did not mention any affiliation to an academic institutions or other overt tokens of scientific legitimacy. Most clinics claimed autologous tissue was the source of treatments (67.3%) and generally did not specify route of administration. Additionally, of the Tijuana clinics identified, 13 claimed licensing, though only 1 matched with available licensing information. Conclusions: Regenerative medicine clinics in Tijuana have a significant online presence using direct-to-consumer advertising to attract stem-cell tourism clientele in a bustling border region between Mexico and the USA. This study adds to existing literature evidencing the unregulated nature of online stem cell offerings and provides further evidence of the need for regulatory harmonization, particularly to address stem cell services being offered online across borders. © 2021, The Author(s).","article; cell therapy; content analysis; direct-to-consumer advertizing; human; human cell; licensing; Mexico; regenerative medicine; risk assessment; search engine; stem cell; tourism; marketing; Mexico; stem cell; Humans; Marketing; Mexico; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cells","BioMed Central Ltd",Article,Scopus

This paper reviews its safety and reactogenicity. A pooled analysis of two pivotal randomized Phase-3 trials (NCT01165177, NCT01165229) in adults ⩾50 years found that more solicited adverse events (AEs) were reported with RZV than placebo. Injection site pain was the most common solicited AE (RZV: 78.0% participants; placebo: 10.9%). Grade-3 pain occurred in 6.4% of RZV and 0.3% of placebo recipients. Myalgia, fatigue, and headache were the most commonly reported general solicited AEs (RZV: 44.7%, 44.5%, and 37.7%, respectively; placebo: 11.7%, 16.5%, and 15.5%, respectively). Most symptoms were mild to moderate in intensity with a median duration of 2–3 days. The intensity of reactogenicity symptoms did not differ substantially after the first and second vaccine doses. The pooled analysis of the pivotal Phase-3 trials did not identify any clinically relevant differences in the overall incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), fatal AEs or potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) between RZV and placebo. Reactogenicity in five studies of immunocompromised patients ⩾18 years (autologous stem cell transplant, human immunodeficiency virus, solid tumors, hematological malignancies, and renal transplant; NCT01610414, NCT01165203, NCT01798056, NCT01767467, and NCT02058589) was consistent with that observed in the pivotal Phase-3 trials. There were no clinically relevant differences between RZV and placebo in the immunocompromised populations with regard to overall incidence of SAEs, fatal AEs, pIMDs, or AEs related to patients’ underlying condition. Post-marketing surveillance found that the most commonly reported AEs were consistent with the reactogenicity profile of the vaccine in clinical trials. Overall, the clinical safety data for RZV are reassuring.

To overcome the limitations of the available therapeutic options, the discovery and development of new, more effective, and safer therapies is required. In this review, the different research steps involved in the process of antimelanoma drug evaluation and selection are explored, including information regarding in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experiments, as well as clinical trial phases. Details are given about the most used cell lines and assays to perform both two- and three-dimensional in vitro screening of drug candidates towards melanoma. For in vivo studies, murine models are, undoubtedly, the most widely used for assessing the therapeutic potential of new compounds and to study the underlying mechanisms of action. Here, the main melanoma murine models are described as well as other animal species. A section is dedicated to ongoing clinical studies, demonstrating the wide interest and successful efforts devoted to melanoma therapy, in particular at advanced stages of the disease, and a final section includes some considerations regarding approval for marketing by regulatory agencies.

Objective: To examine bacterial infections in 20 patients who received umbilical cord blood-derived products marketed as stem cell treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series is a national public health investigation including case-finding, medical record review and abstraction, and laboratory investigation, including sterility testing of products and whole-genome sequencing of patient and product isolates. Participants included patients who developed bacterial infections following administration of umbilical cord blood-derived products marketed as stem cell treatment during August 2017 to September 2018. Data analysis was performed from March 2019 to September 2021. Exposures: Umbilical cord blood-derived products marketed as stem cell treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Data were collected on patient infections and exposures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention performed sterility testing on undistributed and distributed vials of product marketed as stem cell treatment and performed whole-genome sequencing to compare patient and product bacterial isolates. Results: Culture-confirmed bacterial infections were identified in 20 patients (median [range] age, 63 [2-89] years; 13 male patients [65%]) from 8 US states who sought stem cell treatment for conditions including pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and injury; all but 1 required hospitalization. The most frequently isolated bacteria from patients with infections were common enteric species, including Escherichia coli (14 patients) and Enterobacter cloacae (7 patients). Of unopened, undistributed products sampled for testing, 65% (22 of 34 vials) were contaminated with at least 1 of 16 bacterial species, mostly enteric. A patient isolate from Arizona matched isolates obtained from products administered to patients in Florida, and patient isolates from Texas matched undistributed product sent from the company in California. Conclusions and Relevance: Unapproved stem cell products can expose patients to serious risks without proven benefit. Sequencing results suggest a common source of extensive contamination, likely occurring during the processing of cord blood into product. Patients and health care practitioners who are considering the use of unapproved products marketed as stem cell treatment should be aware of their unproven benefits and potential risks, including serious infections. © 2021 Hartnett KP et al.","nose spray; adolescent; adult; adverse outcome; aged; anonymised data; Article; bacterial arthritis; bacterial infection; bloodstream infection; child; clinical article; data analysis; Enterobacter cloacae; epidural abscess; Escherichia coli; female; Florida; health care personnel; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; hepatitis C; hospitalization; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; laboratory test; male; medical record review; osteoarthritis; practice guideline; rheumatoid arthritis; species identification; stem cell transplantation; telephone interview; umbilical cord blood; whole genome sequencing; adverse event; bacterial infection; blood safety; cord blood stem cell transplantation; epidemic; Food and Drug Administration; health survey; marketing; middle aged; preschool child; United States; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bacterial Infections; Blood Safety; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.; Child; Child, Preschool; Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Marketing; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Public Health Surveillance; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration; Young Adult","American Medical Association",Article,Scopus

This innovative treatment, based on a “living drug”, has shown very impressive short-term responses. However, safety profile and complex logistics require high expertise centers and tight collaborations between addressing and treating centers. Current research is exploring the possibility to move to first line ALL with high-risk features and/or first high-risk relapse. More efficient CAR T-cells products, are still lacking to counteract the escape mechanisms already described. Moreover, to define the bridge-to-CAR time for each patient remains a challenge to obtain optimal disease burden allowing expansion and persistence of CAR T-cells. Also difficult is to identify patients who will benefit from further therapy after infusion, such as allogeneic HSCT or may be immuno-modulatory treatment.

Currently, the field has entered the clinical arena with the ambition to fulfil its promises for a permanent fix of incurable genetic disorders. Hemoglobinopathies as target diseases and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) as target cells of genetic interventions had a major share in the research effort toward efficiently implementing gene therapy. Dissection of HSC biology and improvements in gene transfer and gene expression technologies evolved in an almost synchronous manner to a point where the two fields seem to be functionally intercalated. In this review, we focus specifically on the development of gene therapy for hemoglobin disorders and look at both gene addition and gene correction strategies that may dominate the field of HSC-directed gene therapy in the near future and transform the therapeutic landscape for genetic diseases. © Copyright 2021, by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.","hemoglobin F; hemoglobin gamma chain; virus vector; Article; down regulation; ex vivo gene transfer; gene editing; hematopoietic stem cell; hemoglobinopathy; human; in vivo gene transfer; marketing authorization; monogenic disorder; myeloablative conditioning; RNA interference; viral gene therapy; gene therapy; gene vector; genetics; hematopoietic stem cell; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; hemoglobinopathy; Gene Editing; Genetic Therapy; Genetic Vectors; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Hemoglobinopathies; Humans","Mary Ann Liebert Inc.",Article,Scopus

Several pharmaceutical companies use animal-free in vitro models which allow a more rapid selection of lead compounds and contribute to 3Rs principles (‘replace, reduce and refine’) by streamlining the selection of promising compounds submitted to further regulatory studies in animals. Currently available in vitro models typically rely on adherent monolayer cultures or disorganized 3D structures, both of which lack the spatiotemporal and morphological context of the developing embryo. A newly developed 3D ‘gastruloid’ model has the potential to achieve a more reliable prediction of teratogenicity by providing a robust recapitulation of gastrulation-like events alongside morphological coordination at relatively high-throughput. In this first proof-of-concept study, we used both mouse and human gastruloids to examine a panel of seven reference compounds, with associated in vivo data and known teratogenic risk, to quantitatively assess in vitro teratogenicity. We observed several gross morphological effects, including significantly reduced elongation or decreased size of the gastruloids, upon exposure to several of the reference compounds. We also observed aberrant gene expression using fluorescent reporters, including SOX2, BRA, and SOX17, suggestive of multi-lineage differentiation defects and disrupted axial patterning. Finally, we saw that gastruloids recapitulated some of the known in vivo species-specific susceptibilities between their mouse and human counterparts. We therefore suggest that gastruloids represent a powerful tool for teratogenicity assessment by enabling relevant physiological recapitulation of early embryonic development, demonstrating their use as a novel in vitro teratogenic model system. © 2021","bosentan; ibuprofen; penicillin G; phenytoin; retinoic acid; thalidomide; valproic acid; teratogenic agent; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; BRA gene; cell differentiation; concentration response; controlled study; embryo; embryo pattern formation; embryoid body; gastrula; gene; gene expression; human; human cell; human embryonic stem cell; human tissue; in vitro study; monolayer culture; mouse embryonic stem cell; nonhuman; proof of concept; SOX17 gene; SOX2 gene; teratogen testing; teratogenicity; tissue structure; animal; cell culture; drug effect; gastrula; gastrulation; mammalian embryo; mouse; organoid; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Embryo, Mammalian; Gastrula; Gastrulation; Human Embryonic Stem Cells; Humans; Mice; Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells; Organoids; Teratogens","Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus

Recently, UC-derived allograft products have been made available to practitioners in orthopaedics and other specialties, by companies purporting “stem cell”–based healing. However, such marketing claims conflict with existing regulations for these human tissues, generating questions over the cellular and protein composition of current commercially available UC allograft products. Purpose: To evaluate commercial UC allograft products for viable cells, CFU-Fs, and protein makeup. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Five commercial UC allograft products claiming to contain viable, undescribed “stem cells,” 2 obtained from UC blood (UCB) and 3 from UC tissue (UCT), were analyzed. Image-based methods were used to measure cell concentration and viability, a traditional CFU-F assay was used to evaluate in vitro behavior indicative of a connective tissue progenitor cell phenotype often referred to as mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, and quantitative immunoassay arrays were used to measure a combination of cytokines and growth factors. Bone marrow concentrate (BMC) and plasma derived from the blood and bone marrow of middle-aged individuals served as comparative controls for cell culture and protein analyses, respectively. Results: Viable cells were identified within all 5 UC allograft products, with those derived from UCB having greater percentages of living cells (40%-59%) than those from UCT (1%-22%). Compared with autologous BMC (>95% viability and >300 million living cells), no CFU-Fs were observed within any UC allograft product (<15 million living cells). Moreover, a substantial number of proteins, particularly those within UCB allograft products, were undetectable or present at lower concentrations compared with blood and bone marrow plasma controls. Interestingly, several important growth factors and cytokines, including basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and osteoprotegerin, were most prevalent in 1 or more UCT allograft products as compared with blood and bone marrow plasma. Conclusion: CFU-Fs, often referred to as stem cells, were not found within any of the commercial UC allograft products analyzed, and clinicians should remain wary of marketing claims stating otherwise. Clinical Relevance: Any therapeutic benefit of current UC allograft products in orthopaedic medicine is more likely to be attributed to their protein composition (UCT > UCB) or inclusion of cells without colony forming potential (UCB > UCT). © 2021 The Author(s).","allograft; cell culture; cell culture technique; CFU counting; fetus blood; human; middle aged; umbilical cord; Allografts; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells, Cultured; Colony-Forming Units Assay; Fetal Blood; Humans; Middle Aged; Umbilical Cord","SAGE Publications Inc.",Article,Scopus

Their ability to modulate the host immune system and promote tolerance has prompted several allogeneic and autologous hMSC-based clinical trials for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease and several other immune-induced disorders. However, clinical success beyond safety is still controversial and highly variable, with inconclusive therapeutic benefits and little mechanistic explanation. This clinical variability has been broadly attributed to inconsistent MSC sourcing, phenotypic characterization, variable potency, and non-standard isolation protocols, leading to functional heterogeneity among administered MSCs. Homogeneous MSC populations are proposed to yield more predictable, reliable biological responses and clinically meaningful properties relevant to cell-based therapies. Limited comparisons of heterogeneous MSCs with homogenous MSCs are reported. This review addresses this gap in the literature with a critical analysis of strategies aimed at decreasing MSC heterogeneity concerning their reported immunomodulatory profiles. Statement of significance: This review collates, summarizes, and critically analyzes published strategies that seek to improve homogeneity in immunomodulatory functioning MSC populations intended as cell therapies to treat immune-based disorders, such as graft-vs-host-disease. No such review for MSC therapies, immunomodulatory profiles and cell heterogeneity analysis is published. Since MSCs represent the most clinically studied experimental cell therapy platform globally for which there remains no US domestic marketing approval, insights into MSC challenges in therapeutic product development are imperative to providing solutions for immunomodulatory variabilities. © 2021","Cells; Disease control; Diseases; Flowcharting; Grafting (chemical); Quality control; Clonal selection; Critical quality; Critical quality attribute; Potency; Priming; Product release; Product release criteria; Quality attributes; Release criteria; Therapeutic efficacy; Cell culture; cell differentiation; cell heterogeneity; CFU counting; clonal cell line; donor; graft versus host reaction; human; immunomodulation; immunopathology; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; mesenchymal stromal cell therapy; nonhuman; quality control; Review; biological therapy; graft versus host reaction; immunomodulation; mesenchymal stem cell; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Graft vs Host Disease; Humans; Immunomodulation; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells","Acta Materialia Inc",Review,Scopus

Before being allowed to be used and distributed, every new potentially therapeutic compound must be strictly validated during preclinical and clinical trials. The preclinical studies usually involve the in vitro and in vivo evaluation. Due to the increasing reporting of discrepancy in drug effects in animal and humans and the requirement to reduce the number of animals used in research, improvement of in vitro models based on human cells is indispensable. Primary cardiac cells are difficult to access and maintain in cell culture for extensive experiments; therefore, the human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) became an excellent alternative. This technology enables a production of high number of patient- and disease-specific cardiomyocytes and other cardiac cell types for a large-scale research. The drug effects can be extensively evaluated in the context of electrophysiological responses with a use of well-established tools, such as multielectrode array (MEA), patch clamp, or calcium ion oscillation measurements. Cardiotoxicity, which is a common reason for withdrawing drugs from marketing or rejection at final stages of clinical trials, can be easily verified with a use of hiPSC-CM model providing a prediction of human-specific responses and higher safety of clinical trials involving patient cohort. Abovementioned studies can be performed using two-dimensional cell culture providing a high-throughput and relatively lower costs. On the other hand, more complex structures, such as engineered heart tissue, organoids, or spheroids, frequently applied as co-culture systems, represent more physiological conditions and higher maturation rate of hiPSC-derived cells. Furthermore, heart-on-a-chip technology has recently become an increasingly popular tool, as it implements controllable culture conditions, application of various stimulations and continuous parameters read-out. This paper is an overview of possible use of cardiomyocytes and other cardiac cell types derived from hiPSC as in vitro models of heart in drug research area prepared on the basis of latest scientific reports and providing thorough discussion regarding their advantages and limitations. © 2021, The Author(s).","cardiac muscle cell; cardiotoxicity; cell culture; cells by body anatomy; coculture; drug research; drug response; engineered heart tissue; human; in vitro study; induced pluripotent stem cell; nonhuman; organoid; Review; three dimensional cell culture; tumor spheroid; animal; cardiac muscle cell; cytology; drug development; drug effect; heart; heart contraction; induced pluripotent stem cell; lab on a chip; physiology; procedures; Animals; Drug Development; Heart; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Myocardial Contraction; Myocytes, Cardiac","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",Review,Scopus

It also brought together scientists from various disciplines and experiences to discuss recent advances in the use and applications of stem cells. The contributions presented here divide into three main themes: cells; tissue engineering; and clinical applications. Important complementary aspects such as ethics and cell marketing are also discussed.

In 1907, Oberndorfer described “karzinoide” and yet more than a century later, most diagnoses still reflect incurable metastatic disease. Attempts to address the biology and mechanistic basis of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have lacked logic, balanced oversight, or linearity. Governance appears directed to the support of countless clinical trials, often so underpowered and scientifically improbable as to seem based more on marketing premise than medicine. Much science is devoted to the development of potentially commercial applications rather than the elucidation of the mechanisms of neoplastic biology. A variety of organizations with quasi-scientific or commercial interests purport to drive research and diverse studies with no apparent focus or prioritization. Goals more often appear to seek popular acclaim and to accommodate the vogue of public debate by enthusiastic and often uninformed advocates of progress (sic) than to logically address the acquisition of information necessary to facilitate diagnosis and effect cure. Innumerable iterations of tumor nomenclature have been pondered over and discarded as if semantics might effect a cure or theological debate might inform science. Publications are often permutations and commutations of previous work and do little more than plump up personal bibliographies. Innumerable “disease observations” continue to be published, much in the mode of the reports of the early discovers of the globe-like sightings of exotic apparitions or more often, merely “me too” reflections. Treatments have been almost completely co-opted from other cancers and, in the most part, found to be wanting or misleading in their efficacy. Guidelines, eminence based and society based, continue to be presented with metronomic regularity and adopted by “followers”; more remindive of religious exhortations to the faithful endlessly in pursuit of Hippocratic grail. Some progress has been made—somatostatin receptor identification (40 years ago), sundry quasi-effective drugs, theranostics, and receptor targeting—but unfortunately, the molecular mechanistic basis of NETs remains so inadequately defined as to obviate any intervention based on a plausible hypothesis. There needs to be input from persons wise in science, clinical medicine, and strategy development to define rational steps forward to a series of defined goals rather than an interface of the marketplace and client dialog. Short-, intermediate-, and long-term goals need to be defined and developed rather than random excursions into the hinterland of an uncharted disease. Overall, what is obligatory for advance is the development and integration of novel technologies—molecular, mathematical, multianalytic, and genomic based—to provide the biological basis for elucidation of the disease and the development of personalized clinical management. The neuroendocrine community must move beyond the endless and relatively ineffective iterations of known knowledge and define new ways forward.

In recent years, a number of novel and increasingly effective disease-modulatory therapies (DMTs) have been approved, including oral fumarates and selective sphingosine 1-phosphate modulators, as well as cell-depleting therapies such as cladribine, anti-CD20 and anti-CD52 monoclonals. Amongst DMTs in clinical development, inhibitors of Bruton's tyrosine kinase represent an entirely new emerging drug class in MS, with three different drugs entering phase III trials. However, important remaining fields of improvement comprise tracking of long-term benefit-risk with existing DMTs and exploration of novel treatment targets relating to brain inherent disease processes underlying the progressive neurodegenerative aspect of MS, which accumulating evidence suggests start already early in the disease process. The aim here is to review current therapeutic options in relation to an improved understanding of the immunopathogenesis of MS, also highlighting examples where controlled trials have not generated the desired results. An additional aim is to review emerging therapies undergoing clinical development, including agents that interfere with disease processes believed to be important for neurodegeneration or aiming to enhance reparative responses. Notably, early trials now have shown initial evidence of enhanced remyelination both with small molecule compounds and biologicals. Finally, accumulating evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing real-world patient populations, which underscore the importance of early high effective therapy whilst maintaining acceptable tolerability, is discussed. © 2020 The Authors.

In β-thalassaemia there is an underproduction of β-globin chains combined with excess of free α-globin chains. The excess free α-globin chains precipitate in red blood cells, leading to their increased destruction (haemolysis) and ineffective erythropoiesis. The conventional treatment is based on the correction of haemoglobin through regular red blood cell transfusions and treating the iron overload that develops subsequently with iron chelation therapy. Although, early detection and initiations of such supportive treatment has improved the quality of life for people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only widely available therapy with a curative potential. Gene therapy for β-thalassaemia has recently received conditional authorisation for marketing in Europe, and may soon become widely available as another alternative therapy with curative potential for people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different types of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, in people with transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries. Date of the most recent search: 07 April 2021. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with each other or with standard therapy (regular transfusion and chelation regimen). Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened trials and had planned to extract data and assess risk of bias using standard Cochrane methodologies and assess the quality using GRADE approach, but no trials were identified for inclusion in the current review. Main results: No relevant trials were retrieved after a comprehensive search of the literature. Authors' conclusions: We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness and safety of different types of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in people with transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia. The absence of high-level evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions emphasises the need for well-designed, adequately-powered, randomised controlled clinical trials.

Patients considering SCIs may encounter misinformation and seek out guidance from their physicians who are trusted brokers of health information. However, little is known about the perspectives of academic physician specialists toward the SCI industry. The purpose of this study was to capture the attitudes of physician specialists with experience addressing patient questions about unproven SCIs. Methods: The authors undertook 25 semi-structured interviews with academic physicians in cardiology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, pulmonology and neurology primarily from one academic center. Results: The authors identified two major themes: concerns and mediators of appropriateness of offering SCIs as therapies to patients. Specialists were generally aware of the industry and reported scientific and commercial concerns, including the scientific uncertainty of SCIs, medical harms to patients, misleading marketing and its impact on patient informed consent and economic harms due to large out-of-pocket costs for patients. All specialists outside of orthopedics voiced that it was inappropriate to be offering SCIs to patients today. These views were informed by previously expressed concerns surrounding safety and properly informing patients, levels of evidence needed prior to offering SCIs therapeutically and desired qualifications for clinicians. Among the specialties, orthopedists reported that under certain conditions, SCIs may be appropriate for patients with limited clinical options but only when safety is adequate, expectations are managed and patients are well informed about the risks and chances of benefit. Most participants expressed a desire for phase 3 studies and Food and Drug Administration approval prior to marketing SCIs, but some also shared the challenges associated with upholding these thresholds of evidence, especially when caring for out-of-option patients. Conclusions: The authors’ results suggest that medical specialists are aware of the industry and express several concerns surrounding SCIs but differ in their views on the appropriateness and clinical evidence necessary for offering SCIs currently to patients. Additional educational tools may help physicians with patient engagement and expectation management surrounding SCIs. © 2021 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy","advertising; Article; cardiologist; controlled study; female; human; informed consent; interview; male; neurologist; ophthalmologist; physician; physician attitude; priority journal; pulmonologist; semi structured interview; stem cell transplantation; work experience; physician; specialization; stem cell; Humans; Physicians; Specialization; Stem Cells","Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

The aim of this study is to analyze similarities and differences between regulatory pathways followed by the approved ATMPs in both regions. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the ATMPs approved by EU and US regulatory agencies was carried out until May 31, 2020. Data were collected on the features and timing of orphan drug designation (ODD), scientific advice (SA), expedited program designation (EP), marketing authorization application (MAA) and marketing authorization (MA) for both regions. Results: In the EU, a total of fifteen ATMPs were approved (eight gene therapies, three somatic cell therapies, three tissue-engineered products and one combined ATMP), whereas in the USA, a total of nine were approved (five gene therapies and four cell therapies); seven of these were authorized in both regions. No statistical differences were found in the mean time between having the ODD or EP granted and the start of the pivotal clinical trial or MAA in the EU and USA, although the USA required less time for MAA assessment than the EU (mean difference, 5.44, P = 0.012). The MAA assessment was shorter for those products with a PRIME or breakthrough designation. No differences were found in the percentage of ATMPs with expedited MAA assessment between the EU and the USA (33.3% versus 55.5%, respectively, P = 0.285) or in the time required for the MAA expedited review (mean difference 4.41, P = 0.105). Approximately half of the products in both regions required an Advisory Committee during the MAA review, and 60% required an oral explanation in the EU. More than half of the approved ATMPs (67% and 55.55% in the EU and the USA, respectively) were granted an ODD, 70% by submitting preliminary clinical data in the EU. The mean number of SA and protocol assistance per product conducted by the European Medicines Agency was 1.71 and 3.75, respectively, and only 13% included parallel advice with health technology assessment bodies. A total of 53.33% of the products conducted the first SA after the pivotal clinical study had started, reporting more protocol amendments. Finally, of the seven ATMPs authorized in both regions, the type of MA differed for only two ATMPs (28.6%), and four out of eight products non-commercialized in the USA had a non-standard MA in the EU. Conclusions: The current approved ATMPs mainly target orphan diseases. Although EU and US regulatory procedures may differ, the main regulatory milestones reached by the approved ATMPs are similar in both regions, with the exception of the time for MAA evaluation, the number of authorized products in the regions and the type of authorization for some products. More global regulatory convergence might further simplify and expedite current ATMP development in these regions. © 2020 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy","alipogene tiparvovec; axicabtagene ciloleucel; azficel T; betibeglogene autotemcel; darvadstrocel; gintuit; holoclar; nalotimagene carmaleucel; onasemnogene abeparvovec; orphan drug; sipuleucel T; spherox; strimvelis; talimogene laherparepvec; tisagenlecleucel T; voretigene neparvovec; zalmoxis; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; advisory committee; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; allotransplantation; anus fistula; Article; articular cartilage; B cell lymphoma; beta thalassemia; biological therapy; cartilage injury; castration resistant prostate cancer; chondrocyte; chondropathy; comparative study; controlled study; cornea disease; cornea lesion; cornea limbus; Crohn disease; cutaneous melanoma; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; drug approval; drug distribution; drug marketing; European Union; ex vivo study; experimental therapy; eye burn; femoral condyle; follicular lymphoma; follow up; Food and Drug Administration; gingiva disease; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; hyperlipoproteinemia type 1; inoperable cancer; keratinocyte; large cell lymphoma; Leber congenital amaurosis; legal aspect; leukemia relapse; limbal stem cell deficiency; limbal stem cell deficiency; lymph node metastasis; mediastinum cancer; melanoma; metastasis; mucogingival disease; nasolabial fold; pancreatitis; patella; pre B lymphocyte; primary tumor; priority journal; recurrent disease; retina dystrophy; retrospective study; severe combined immunodeficiency; somatic cell therapy; spinal muscular atrophy; systemic therapy; T lymphocyte; thalassemia intermedia; thalassemia major; United States; visual impairment; wrinkle; biological therapy; drug approval; European Union; experimental therapy; gene therapy; United States; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Drug Approval; European Union; Genetic Therapy; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Therapies, Investigational; United States","Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

However, the safety and efficacy of Pola+BR outside of a clinical trial setting is unknown. Patients and Methods: We analyzed use of pola-based therapy at 5 centers in the United States, including dose, response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), survival, and toxicity. Results: Sixty-nine patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma, including 66 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma/high-grade B-cell lymphoma and 84% refractory to prior therapy, were treated. Responses occurred in of 50%, including 24% complete response. Median duration of response was 5.1 months, PFS was 2.0 months, and survival was 5.3 months, at 4 months median follow-up. Inferior PFS was associated with prior refractory disease (median, 57 days vs. not reached; P = .003) and lack of response to Pola+BR (PFS, 27 days vs. 152 days; P < .001). Discontinuation owing to planned cellular therapy was seen in 36% and owing to toxicity occurred in 12%; unplanned hospitalizations occurred in 36%. Conclusions: We conclude that commercial Pola is applied to highly refractory lymphomas at our centers, often with intent to bridge to subsequent therapy. Although some clinical benefit was observed, efficacy was inferior to clinical trial data, especially among those with refractory disease. Relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma poses a significant therapeutic challenge. The approval of polatuzumab, in combination with bendamustine and rituximab, represents a new treatment option. To clarify post-marketing use of polatuzumab-based therapy, we pooled data from 5 medical centers in the United States.

However, some crowdfunding campaigns identify academic medical centers as destinations for individuals seeking access to stem cell products provided either in clinical studies or on an expanded access basis. This study examines crowdfunding campaigns seeking funds to enable children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder access to stem cell interventions. Methods: This study compares and contrasts crowdfunding campaigns, identifying an international stem cell clinic marketing a purported umbilical cord blood-derived stem cell treatment for autism spectrum disorder, with campaigns soliciting donations intended to help children with autism spectrum disorder either participate in clinical studies or obtain expanded access to stem cell products provided at an academic medical center in the US. Results: Campaigns connected to both sites contained inaccurate claims. However, campaigns identifying the international clinic as the intended destination site made stronger claims about efficacy and were more reliant upon testimonials than campaigns listing the US-based academic medical center as the planned clinical site. Acknowledging these important distinctions, clinical studies and press releases associated with the academic medical center played an important role in lending the perception of credibility to the putative stem cell treatments marketed by the international clinic. Conclusions: The study's findings emphasize how important it is for researchers at academic medical centers and comparable research facilities to avoid engaging in stem cell hyperbole; highlight the preliminary nature of early clinical studies; ensure that any claims about safety and efficacy are based upon robust and reliable evidence; and promote responsible science communication by exercising restraint when crafting press releases, conducting media interviews and otherwise publicizing clinical research findings. © 2020 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy","Article; autism; child; clinical research; controlled study; direct-to-consumer advertizing; double blind procedure; funding; health center; human; perception; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; stem cell; umbilical cord blood; United States; autism; crowdsourcing; stem cell transplantation; university hospital; Academic Medical Centers; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Crowdsourcing; Humans; Stem Cell Transplantation","Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

This is in part caused by animal models that fail to predict various human adverse drug reactions (ADRs), resulting in undetected hepatotoxicity at the non-clinical phase of drug development. In an effort to increase the prediction of human hepatotoxicity, different approaches to enhance the physiological relevance of hepatic in vitro systems are being pursued. Three-dimensional (3D) or microfluidic technologies allow to better recapitulate hepatocyte organization and cell-matrix contacts, to include additional cell types, to incorporate fluid flow and to create gradients of oxygen and nutrients, which have led to improved differentiated cell phenotype and functionality. This comprehensive review addresses the drug-induced hepatotoxicity mechanisms and the currently available 3D liver in vitro models, their characteristics, as well as their advantages and limitations for human hepatotoxicity assessment. In addition, since toxic responses are greatly dependent on the culture model, a comparative analysis of the toxicity studies performed using two-dimensional (2D) and 3D in vitro strategies with recognized hepatotoxic compounds, such as paracetamol, diclofenac, and troglitazone is performed, further highlighting the need for harmonization of the respective characterization methods. Finally, taking a step forward, we propose a roadmap for the assessment of drugs hepatotoxicity based on fully characterized fit-for-purpose in vitro models, taking advantage of the best of each model, which will ultimately contribute to more informed decision-making in the drug development and risk assessment fields. © Copyright © 2021 Serras, Rodrigues, Cipriano, Rodrigues, Oliveira and Miranda.","diclofenac; paracetamol; troglitazone; bioprinting; drug metabolism; human; in vitro study; liver metabolism; microfluidics; multicellular spheroid; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); Review; stem cell transplantation; toxic hepatitis","Frontiers Media S.A.",Review,Scopus

Hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold promise for predicting clinical drug effects, given their human-specific properties and their ability to harbor genetically determined characteristics that underlie inter-individual variations in drug response. Currently, the fetal-like properties and heterogeneity of hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes differentiated from iPSCs make them physiologically different from their counterparts isolated from primary tissues and limit their use for predicting clinical drug effects. To address this hurdle, there have been ongoing advances in differentiation and maturation protocols to improve the quality and use of iPSC-differentiated lineages. Among these are in vitro hepatic and cardiac cellular microsystems that can further enhance the physiology of cultured cells, can be used to better predict drug adverse effects, and investigate drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics to facilitate successful drug development. In this article, we discuss how cellular microsystems can establish microenvironments for these applications and propose how they could be used for potentially controlling the differentiation of hepatocytes or cardiomyocytes. The physiological relevance of cells is enhanced in cellular microsystems by simulating properties of tissue microenvironments, such as structural dimensionality, media flow, microfluidic control of media composition, and co-cultures with interacting cell types. Recent studies demonstrated that these properties also affect iPSC differentiations and we further elaborate on how they could control differentiation efficiency in microengineered devices. In summary, we describe recent advances in the field of cellular microsystems that can control the differentiation and maturation of hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes for drug evaluation. We also propose how future research with iPSCs within engineered microenvironments could enable their differentiation for scalable evaluations of drug effects. © 2020 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; cell aggregation; cell differentiation; cell interaction; coculture; controlled study; decellularization; drug effect; drug metabolism; drug response; drug screening; drug toxicity; drug transformation; electric conductivity; heart development; human; induced pluripotent stem cell; liver cell; machine learning; marketing; mechanotransduction; microenvironment; microfluidic analysis; microfluidics; nonhuman; pharmacokinetics; regenerative medicine; Review; standardization; tissue engineering; toxicity testing; adverse drug reaction; animal; cardiac muscle; cardiac muscle cell; cell culture; cytology; drug development; induced pluripotent stem cell; liver; liver cell; metabolism; pathology; physiology; procedures; tumor microenvironment; drug; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Cellular Microenvironment; Drug Development; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Hepatocytes; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Liver; Microfluidics; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Pharmaceutical Preparations","SAGE Publications Inc.",Review,Scopus

After its approval in Japan in 2014 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, we carried out a 3-year prospective observational post-marketing surveillance study in Japanese patients (Japanese Study of Tofogliflozin with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients/Long Term [J-STEP/LT]). Materials and Methods: This surveillance was carried out between September 2014 and February 2019, and recorded safety in terms of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and ADRs of special interest, and effectiveness in terms of changes in glycated hemoglobin and bodyweight from baseline to last observation carried forward. Results: Of 6,897 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus registered, 6,711 and 6,451 were analyzed for safety and effectiveness, respectively. ADRs were reported in 846 patients (12.61%), with serious ADRs in 101 patients (1.5%). ADRs of special interest included hypoglycemia (62 patients [0.9%]), polyuria/pollakiuria (90 [1.3%]), volume depletion-related disorders (135 [2.0%]), urinary tract infections (91 [1.4%]), genital infections (117 [1.7%]) and skin diseases (53 [0.8%]). One case of diabetic ketoacidosis was reported. The mean ± standard deviation changes from baseline to last observation carried forward in glycated hemoglobin and bodyweight were −0.68 ± 1.34% (n = 6,158, P < 0.0001) and −3.13 ± 4.67 kg (n = 5,213, P < 0.0001), respectively. Conclusions: J-STEP/LT, a 3-year, prospective, observational, post-marketing study in Japan, found no unprecedented ADRs, and consistent reductions from baseline in glycated hemoglobin and bodyweight over the observation period. The present results provide further evidence regarding the safety and tolerability of tofogliflozin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. © 2020 Sanofi K.K.

With the increasing understanding of OA, the sex differences have attracted specific attention as the burden of OA is greater in women. There is no doubt that gender-specific OA management has great potential for precision treatment. On the other hand, from the marketing aspect, a medication targeting the OA-responsive biomarker(s) shared by both genders is more favorable for drug development. Thus, in the current study, a published transcriptome dataset of knee articular cartilage was used to compare OA and healthy samples for identifying the genes with the same significantly different expression trend in both males and females. With 128 genes upregulated and 143 genes downregulated in both OA males and females, 9 KEGG pathways have been enriched based on the current knowledge, including ‘renal cell carcinoma,’ ‘ECM-receptor interaction,’ ‘HIF-1 signaling pathway,’ ‘MicroRNAs in cancer,’ ‘focal adhesion,’ ‘Relaxin signaling pathway,’ ‘breast cancer,’ ‘PI3K-Akt signaling pathway,’ and ‘human papillomavirus infection.’ Here, we explore the potential impacts of these clusters in OA. We also analyze the identified ‘cell plasma membrane related genes’ in-depth to identify the potential chondrocyte cell surface target(s) of OA management. © 2021 by the authors.

Apart from a few officially approved products, many private providers have decided to bring these options into the healthcare system and bring them closer to patients. Due to the rapidly evolving knowledge of the mechanism of action of MSCs, many patients may be imperfectly informed about the risks and benefits of treatment. In addition, the marketing of some private providers may amplify incomplete or false knowledge assumptions that the public has. The provision of MSCs therapies affects and is likely to significantly affect the entire Czech Republic in the future. Addressing this issue should not be based solely on regulatory authorities. We believe that it should also be addressed by all doctors and especially by general practitioners. This article provides basic information on the issue of MSCs therapies in a form that can contribute to patient awareness through physicians. By the year 2019, more than 55,000 publications on the topic of mesenchymal stem cells were published since their first isolation in 1992 and MSCs have been applied to over 10,000 patients in clinical trials.

While knowledge of adipose-resident progenitor and stem cells has existed for over 50 years, the ability to extract such cells from tissue discarded in bulk from routine clinical procedures facilitated a pace of research and discovery far more robust than for other stem cell populations. Thus, research with ASCs has encompassed a broad spectrum of ideas, scientific approaches, and technologies, and there is significant diversity in perspectives represented in literature. Clinical, scientific, and industry contributors across numerous disciplines have propelled the field forward. Perhaps due to such ease of access to adipose tissue, the field of adipose stem cell therapy has not been without some controversy, and rogue operators have unfortunately brought the safety of ASCs into question and prompted evolution of regulatory guidelines. Despite the advent of marketing claims sometimes getting ahead of the science, the field of adipose stem cells has great promise to improve the care of patients with many disorders. The ability to understand and leverage the biology of cell populations within the ubiquitous adipose depots will continue to drive the development of new diverse therapies based on principles of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",,"Elsevier",Book Chapter,Scopus

This is where the nasal route of delivery has proven to be the most helpful tool in providing ease of administration. Despite the obstacles, smart polymers, nasal enhancers, nanotechnology-based delivery systems, and computational modeling tools have all been used to increase the nasal route's residence time and absorption window. This review highlights the systemic delivery of macromolecules such as protein and hormones, which can also be delivered via nose-to-brain through various transportation pathways. This strategy has proved beneficial in treating several neurological disorders like brain tumors, Alzheimer's, Ischem-ic stroke, etc. Except for the marketed preparation and patents, several other drugs are still under clinical trials.

It was originally developed in Japan to treat strokes and has been used there since 2001. Aside from its anti-oxidative effects, edaravone demonstrated beneficial effects on pro-inflammatory responses, nitric oxide production, and apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, edaravone has shown neuroprotective effects in several animal models of diseases other than stroke. In particular, edaravone administration was found to be effective in halting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression during the early stages. Accordingly, after its success in Phase III clinical studies, edaravone has been approved by the FDA as a treatment for ALS patients. Considering its promises in neurological disorders and its safety in patients, edaravone is a drug of interest that can be repurposed for traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment. Drug repurposing is a novel approach in drug development that identifies drugs for purposes other than their original indication. This review presents the biochemical properties of edaravone along with its effects on several neurological disorders in the hope that it can be adopted for treating TBI patients. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","3 nitrotyrosine; acetylsalicylic acid; adenosine triphosphate; atorvastatin; cytokine; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; low density lipoprotein; nitric oxide; norphenazone; oxidized low density lipoprotein; ozagrel; reactive oxygen metabolite; vasculotropin; drug; neuroprotective agent; norphenazone; scavenger; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; apoptosis; behavior; blood brain barrier; blood vessel permeability; brain concussion; brain edema; brain infarction; brain infarction size; brain vasospasm; cerebrovascular accident; cognitive defect; depression; disease duration; DNA damage; dose response; drug approval; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug indication; drug marketing; drug mechanism; drug repositioning; drug safety; Food and Drug Administration; forced swim test; human; immune response; inflammation; ischemic stroke; Japan; lipid peroxidation; loading drug dose; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; neurologic disease; neuroprotection; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); phase 4 clinical trial (topic); randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; stem cell; stroke patient; traumatic brain injury; treatment outcome; United States; x-ray computed tomography; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; animal; drug repositioning; traumatic brain injury; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Animals; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Drug Repositioning; Edaravone; Free Radical Scavengers; Humans; Neuroprotective Agents; Pharmaceutical Preparations","Bentham Science Publishers",Review,Scopus

While these unique immunotherapies have improved outcomes for pediatric and adult patients in a number of disease states, as 'living drugs,' their toxicity profiles, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), differ markedly from conventional cancer therapeutics. At the time of article preparation, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, and brexucabtagene autoleucel, all of which are IEC therapies based on genetically modified T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and additional products are expected to reach marketing authorization soon and to enter clinical development in due course. As IEC therapies, especially CAR T cell therapies, enter more widespread clinical use, there is a need for clear, cohesive recommendations on toxicity management, motivating the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) to convene an expert panel to develop a clinical practice guideline. The panel discussed the recognition and management of common toxicities in the context of IEC treatment, including baseline laboratory parameters for monitoring, timing to onset, and pharmacological interventions, ultimately forming evidence- and consensus-based recommendations to assist medical professionals in decision-making and to improve outcomes for patients. © 2020 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).","axicabtagene ciloleucel; brexucabtagene autoleucel; tisagenlecleucel T; immunologic factor; adverse event; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; anticoagulant therapy; antiretroviral therapy; arterial oxygen saturation; Article; brain edema; breathing rate; cancer immunotherapy; cardiovascular risk; CD4 lymphocyte count; clinical practice; cytokine production; cytokine release syndrome; cytotoxicity; decision making; echocardiography; effector cell; health care system; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; humoral immunity; immunophenotyping; immunosuppressive treatment; immunotherapy; infection; neurotoxicity; practice guideline; priority journal; prophylaxis; prospective study; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; risk factor; signal transduction; speckle tracking echocardiography; adverse drug reaction; human; immunology; immunotherapy; practice guideline; procedures; retrospective study; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Immunotherapy; Retrospective Studies","BMJ Publishing Group",Article,Scopus

In particular, this study gives special consideration to the risk potential for vulnerable patient communities navigating health information through Google search. Utilising a crowd-sourced 'Black Box' audit with a browser plugin, we captured the continued presence of prohibited and problematic advertisements returned by stem cell-related queries in the months following Google's ban. In the domain of Search Engine Marketing (SEM), emerging stem cell treatments are situated in a critical juncture between advertisers and potentially vulnerable users with Google Search as an unobserved mediator. Addressing the issues raised by this data collection is of utmost importance in the protection of patient populations online.

Combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy result in high cure rate, nevertheless, up to a quarter of patients with advanced stage cHL may relapse. One mechanism of relapse is through immune evasion; cHL can avoid immune destruction by manipulating T cell regulatory protein programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) interaction. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs), such as pembrolizumab are effective in relapsed/refractory (R/R) cHL. Areas covered: We reviewed prior and ongoing investigation of pembrolizumab use in R/R cHL, maintenance after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and in frontline setting. Phase I study of pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-013) demonstrated safety in R/R cHL with subsequent phase II study (KEYNOTE-087) confirmed efficacy signal. Intriguing early data support the use of maintenance pembrolizumab after ASCT in high-risk cHL patients. Second line and frontline studies incorporating CPIs have demonstrated promising efficacy with no significant additive toxicities. Expert opinion: Immune CPIs that block PD-1/PD-L1 and PD-L2 interaction are an effective strategy in R/R cHL. Pembrolizumab demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of R/R cHL. The optimal utilization of pembrolizumab in frontline therapy is under investigation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","brentuximab vedotin; dacarbazine; doxorubicin; nivolumab; pembrolizumab; programmed death 1 ligand 1; programmed death 1 ligand 2; programmed death 1 receptor; vinblastine; vorinostat; monoclonal antibody; pembrolizumab; allogeneic stem cell transplantation; Article; autologous stem cell transplantation; cancer immunotherapy; chimeric antigen receptor immunotherapy; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; cost effectiveness analysis; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug marketing; drug metabolism; drug safety; drug withdrawal; Food and Drug Administration; government regulation; high risk patient; Hodgkin disease; human; hypothyroidism; nausea; neutropenia; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); pneumonia; autotransplantation; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Hodgkin disease; multimodality cancer therapy; pathology; tumor recurrence; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Combined Modality Therapy; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Hodgkin Disease; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Transplantation, Autologous","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Maintenance therapy with lenalidomide (Len-Mt) extends survival and delays relapse and the subsequent initiation of costly second-line regimens. Here, we report the cost-effectiveness of Len-Mt following ASCT from a Dutch healthcare service perspective. Methods: A partitioned survival model was developed to assess the lifetime costs and benefits for patients with NDMM. Efficacy was taken from a pooled meta-analysis of clinical trial data. Costs and subsequent therapy data were taken from sources appropriate for the Dutch market. Results: Lenalidomide produced a quality-adjusted life year gain of 2.46 and a life year gain of 2.79 vs no maintenance treatment. The cost of lenalidomide was partially offset by savings of EUR 77 462 in subsequent treatment costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Len-Mt vs no maintenance treatment was EUR 30 143. Key model drivers included subsequent therapies, dosing schedule, and time horizon. Conclusion: Lenalidomide is cost-effective after ASCT vs no maintenance therapy in the Netherlands. By extending PFS, lenalidomide delays the cost burdens associated with relapse and subsequent treatment lines. © 2020 The Authors.

Although it may be reasonable to assume feasibility and efficiency of apheresis for CAR-T cell manufacture, several idiosyncrasies of these patients warrant their separate analysis: target cells (mononuclear cells [MNC] and T-cells) are relatively few which may instruct the selection of apheresis technology, low body weight, and, hence, low total blood volume (TBV) can restrict process and product volume, and patients may be in compromised health. We here report outcome data from 46 consecutive leukaphereses in 33 unique pediatric patients performed for the purpose of CD19-CAR-T-cell manufacturing. Apheresis targets of 2×109 MNC/1×109 T-cells were defined by marketing authorization holder specification. Patient weight was 8 to 84 kg; TBV was 0.6 to 5.1 L. Spectra Optia apheresis technology was used. For 23 patients, a single apheresis sufficed to generate enough cells and manufacture CAR-T-cells, the remainder required two aphereses to meet target dose and/or two apheresis series because of production failure. Aphereses were technically feasible and clinically tolerable without serious adverse effects. The median collection efficiencies for MNC and T-cells were 53% and 56%, respectively. In summary, CAR apheresis in pediatric patients, including the very young, is feasible, safe and efficient, but the specified cell dose targets can be challenging in smaller children.

Vyxeos was designated as an orphan medicinal product on January 11, 2012. The applicant for this medicinal product was Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited. Vyxeos is a liposomal formulation of a fixed combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine, antineoplastic agents that inhibit topoisomerase II activity and also cause DNA damage. The strength of Vyxeos is 5 units/mL, where 1 unit equals 1.0 mg cytarabine plus 0.44 mg daunorubicin. The marketing authorization holder Jazz Pharmaceuticals had found that this was an optimal ratio for the efficacy of the product. Study CLTR0310-301, a phase III, multicenter, randomized, trial of Vyxeos (daunorubicin-cytarabine) liposome injection versus standard 3+7 daunorubicin and cytarabine in patients aged 60–75 years with untreated high-risk (secondary) AML, showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups in overall survival (OS) with a median OS of 9.56 months in the daunorubicin-cytarabine arm compared with 5.95 months for standard chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–0.90; one-sided p =.003). The most common side effects were hypersensitivity including rash, febrile neutropenia, edema, diarrhea/colitis, mucositis, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, cough, headache, chills, arrhythmia, pyrexia, sleep disorders, and hypotension. Implications for Practice: Vyxeos has demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in overall survival compared with the standard of care 7+3 in the proposed population of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplasia-related changes and therapy-related AML.

The current review aimed at outlining (1) the ethical challenges facing the implementation of SCI; (2) the applicability of the currently available SCI; and (3) recommendations to achieve ethical, well-regulated incorporation of SCI in the clinical setting. Recent Findings: Concerns regarding the inadequate characterization, poor adverse effects disclosure, and unorthodox, often inappropriate, market practices have engendered a genuine concern regarding the SCI compliance with ethical standards. Six instances of litigation on the basis of misrepresentation or inappropriate informed consent were recorded between 2012 and 2018. Such concerns have been furthered by the loopholes in the regulatory aspect governing the use of SCI coupled with the unclear literature-reported efficacy and diverse spectrum of profess indications. Similarly, the application of SCI in the clinical field is yet to prove its value. The uncertain efficacy, coupled with obscure true-costs of utilization, impedes a value-based assessment.

Actinidia chinensis Planch is one of the few species of genus Actinidia that are domesticated and cultivated for fruit production. It possesses less cold hardiness and is cultivated in limited areas. Another commercial species Actinidia arguta (Sieb. & Zucc.) Planch. ex Miq. is regarded as highly cold resistant, which can withstand a temperature up to -30℃. Actinidia eriantha is another commercial species that has very poor cold resistance. Adverse climatic conditions can lead kiwifruit plants to the freezing injury, which is one of the most important abiotic stresses in horticultural crops. Freezing injury can disrupt biosynthetic activity of plants by disturbing the normal function of their physiological processes. Low temperature can dramatically reduce the area and production of kiwifruit worldwide, which results in a dramatical reduction or destroying the orchard. In China and worldwide, there are many freezing injuries in kiwifruit every year, bringing out tremendous economical loss. In recent years, the issue of cold resistance of kiwifruit has attracted much attention and researchers have made great progress in it. In this review, we systematically summarize the causes of freezing injury, methods of cold resistance identification, investigation of freezing damage in main cold years, identification and evaluation of cold resistance in main cultivars and wild resources of kiwifruit, physiological and molecular mechanism of cold resistance and methods for cold prevention in kiwifruit. Furthermore, the future research fields of kiwifruit cold resistance were prospected. Among them, previous observations have indicated that kiwifruit may incur serious freezing injury in spring on young shoots and flower buds, in autumn on fruits and leaves and in winter on main arms, canes, and dormant buds. In spring and summer, very mild frosts can cause damage to young shoots, flower buds and flowers. In autumn, mild frosts can cause premature leaf abscission and damage to fruit before harvest, resulting in the fruit unsuitable for storage and marketing. In winter, severe frosts can result in considerable damage to arms and canes of dormant vines. A comprehensive understanding of the seasonal changes can help us prevent and decrease the freezing damage to kiwifruit. Cold resistance, defined as the ability of plants to withstand sub-freezing temperatures without sustaining significant damage, is an important criterion for evaluation of the cultivation potential of a species or cultivar for breeding or selection purpose. Past research work conducted by researchers from various countries on cold hardiness of commercial kiwifruit cultivars have provided us suitable temperature for their planting. Some other cultivars are reported to be harder than commonly planted cultivar like'Hayward', but so far limited information is available about their cold hardiness of specific cultivars or species of Actinidia. A deep understanding about the cold hardiness of different kiwifruit varieties will help us in their plantation and breeding programs. Cold injury in plants can cause lipid peroxidation and an increase in electrolyte leakage. As a result, poor cold resistant material shows an increased electroconductivity and malonaldehyde (MDA) contents than strong cold resistant ones. Meanwhile, cold tolerant varieties accumulates higher amount of soluble sugar, soluble protein, superoxide dismutase (SOD) than cold sensitive varieties in order to protect plant cells under cold stress. Previously, these physiological indices have been used frequently to evaluate cold hardiness of kiwifruit plants. The stem structure implied the ability of cold resistance and the thickness of collenchyma, the ratio of collenchyma thickness to cane diameter, and the ratio of xylem thickness to cane diameter could be used as a morphological index to evaluate the cold resistance of kiwifruit. There is very little report available on molecular mechanism of cold resistance in kiwifruit. Over expression of CBF transcription factor regulated by ICE gene can impart the cold resistance in kiwifruit. Moreover, MYB transcription factors also play an important role in cold hardiness of kiwifruit. The product of sugar synthesis and starch degradation will provide energy for kiwifruit to withstand low temperature, the ability of degradation of starch is different in different varieties, and key genes in different varieties related to these metabolic pathway need to be researched. The development of omics technology gives us great opportunity to study the mechanism of cold resistance in detail. Kiwifruit as a newly-developed commercial fruit has a good development prospect. Until now, studies on many aspects of kiwifruit have already been reported. Cold stress is a main limiting factor adversely influencing kiwifruit industry worldwide. In the future, we suggest using advanced scientific method to forecast weather change to guide and prevent freezing damage to kiwifruit plants. In addition, extensive research on molecular mechanism should be carried out in order to dig out the excellent cold resistance genes that will provide theoretical basis for the introduction and breeding of cold resistant varieties. © 2020, Office of Journal of the Fruit Science.

Post-marketing data with this new agent are scarce. Methods: We compared the incidence of both CMV reactivation (any viremia) and clinically significant CMV infection (CS-CMVi; CMV DNAemia leading to preemptive treatment or presence of CMV tissue invasive disease) at days +100 and +200 post-HCT in 25 adult allogeneic HCT patients who received letermovir prophylaxis (until day 100) and a historical control group of 106 CMV R+ allogeneic HCT recipients who underwent CMV preemptive therapy. Results: CMV reactivation within 100 days post-HCT was lower in the letermovir group vs control group (20% vs 72% respectively, P <.001). The 100-day cumulative incidence of CS-CMVi was significantly lower in the letermovir group vs control group (4% vs 59% respectively, P <.001). Significantly reduced incidence of CMV reactivation and CS-CMVi was also observed at 200 days in the letermovir group. No difference in mortality was observed between the two groups. Conclusion: This study confirms the efficacy of letermovir in preventing CMV reactivation in CMV R+ allogeneic HCT recipients in first 100 days post-HCT and suggests sustained efficacy after discontinuation of prophylaxis. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 receptor signaling and proliferation in cells exogenously expressing FLT3 including FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), FLT3 D835Y, and FLT3 ITD D835Y, and it induced apoptosis in leukemic cells expressing FLT3 ITD. The recommended starting dose of gilteritinib is 120 mg (three 40 mg tablets) once daily. Gilteritinib was evaluated in one, phase III, open-label, multicenter, randomized study of gilteritinib (n = 247, gilteritinib arm) versus salvage chemotherapy (n = 124, salvage chemotherapy arm) in patients with relapsed or refractory AML with FLT3 mutation. Overall survival (OS) was statistically significantly different between the two groups with a median OS of 9.3 months in the gilteritinib arm compared with 5.6 months for salvage chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.637; 95% confidence interval, 0.490–0.830; p =.0004 one-sided log-rank test). The most common adverse reactions with gilteritinib treatment were blood creatine phosphokinase increase, alanine aminotransferase increase, aspartate aminotransferase increase, blood alkaline phosphatase increase, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, constipation, cough, peripheral edema, dyspnea, dizziness, hypotension, pain in extremity, asthenia, arthralgia, and myalgia. The objective of this article is to summarize the scientific review of the application leading to regulatory approval in the EU. Implications for Practice: Xospata was approved in the European Union as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutation. Gilteritinib resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement of overall survival compared with salvage chemotherapy. At the time of the marketing authorization of gilteritinib, there were no approved standard therapies specifically for adult patients diagnosed with relapsed or refractory AML with FLT3 mutation.

Due to their regulatory status, the development of hMSC-based products is regulated by specific criteria that range from the design phase, nonclinical studies, clinical studies, to the final registration and approval. Patients should only be administered hMSC-based products within the framework of a clinical trial or after the product has obtained marketing authorization; in both cases, authorization by health authorities is usually required. Considering the above, this paper describes the current general regulatory requirements for hMSC-based products, by jurisdiction, to be implemented throughout their entire development process.

Like every year, after the ECTRIMS Congress, renowned Spanish neurologists who are experts in multiple sclerosis presented the main novelties in research in this field at the Post-ECTRIMS Meeting. Aim. To summarise the content presented at the 12th edition of the Post-ECTRIMS Meeting, which took place in September 2019 in Sevilla and is presented in two parts. Development. In this second part, the most recent evidence on the use of disease-modifying treatments during pregnancy is presented. Details are provided concerning the results of phase 3 clinical trials conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two potential disease-modifying treatments for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: ponesimod and ofatumumab. For the progressive forms, both available disease modifying treatments and others still in the research phase are reviewed. In the field of stem cell therapies, the article includes the results of the only clinical trial carried out to date comparing patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis treated with autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and those treated with disease-modifying therapies. There are no important developments as regards symptomatic treatments, although the European Academy of Neurology has published a guide on palliative care. The various sources of information that collect pharmacovigilance data in the post-marketing setting are reviewed. Conclusions. Patients diagnosed in recent years tend to have less severe multiple sclerosis, probably due to the fact that it is diagnosed in its milder stages together with the steady increase in the number of treatments available. © 2020 Revista de Neurologia.

The marketing authorization holder for this medicinal product is Genzyme Europe B.Th. The adoption was for an extension of the existing adult indication in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to pediatric patients (aged 1 year to <18 years) to enhance mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in children with lymphoma or solid malignant tumors. This treatment is indicated either preemptively, when circulating stem cell count on the predicted day of collection after adequate mobilization with G-CSF (with or without chemotherapy) is expected to be insufficient with regard to desired hematopoietic stem cells yield, or in children who previously failed to collect sufficient hematopoietic stem cells. The efficacy and safety of plerixafor were evaluated in an open label, multicenter, phase I/II, dose-ranging, and randomized controlled study (DFI12860) in pediatric patients with solid tumors, including neuroblastoma, sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, or lymphoma, who were eligible for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Forty-five patients (aged 1 year to <18 years) were randomized, 2:1, using 0.24 mg/kg of plerixafor plus standard mobilization (G-CSF with or without chemotherapy) versus control (standard mobilization alone). The primary analysis showed that 80% of patients in the plerixafor arm experienced at least a doubling of the peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ count, observed from the morning of the day preceding the first planned apheresis to the morning prior to apheresis, versus 28.6% of patients in the control arm (p =.0019). The median increase in PB CD34+ cell counts from baseline to the day of apheresis was 3.2-fold in the plerixafor arm versus by 1.4-fold in the control arm. The observed safety profile in the pediatric population was consistent with that in adults, with adverse events mainly related to injection site reactions, hypokalemia, and increased blood bicarbonate. Importantly, plerixafor exposure did not seem to negatively affect transplant efficiency.

ATMPs and CGTPs comprise gene and cell therapy medicinal products, tissue-engineered products, or the incorporation of one of these products into a medical device. Cited examples of ATMPs are autologous CD34+ cells encoding for the βA-T87Q-globin gene, CAR (chimeric antigen receptor)-T cell immunotherapy medicines, genome editing products, and engineered heart muscle patches constructed from induced human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) for remuscularization of the failing human heart. The nonclinical assessment of efficacy and safety of ATMPs for undertaking human clinical trials requires innovative, product-specific strategies. In order to succeed in gaining marketing approval for these novel medicines, sponsors should establish well-defined collaborative relationships with the appropriate regulatory authorities. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","betibeglogene autotemcel; CD34 antigen; hemoglobin beta chain; tisagenlecleucel T; cardiac muscle; cardiac muscle cell; cell therapy; chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy; Conference Paper; follow up; Food and Drug Administration; gene editing; gene therapy; human; nonhuman; pluripotent stem cell; regenerative medicine; somatic cell therapy; adverse event; animal; biological therapy; devices; gene therapy; health care organization; immunotherapy; pharmacology; procedures; tissue engineering; Animals; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Equipment and Supplies; Genetic Therapy; Humans; Immunotherapy; Pharmacology; Societies, Scientific; Tissue Engineering","Taylor and Francis Ltd",Conference Paper,Scopus

Manipulation of co-inhibitory receptors has achieved tumor eradication in a minority of patients, but widespread immune-related adverse events (irAEs) compromised tolerance to healthy self-tissues in the majority. We have proposed that a major mechanism of irAEs is similar to a graft-versus-malignancy effect of graft-versus-host disease. To verify our hypothesis, we retrieved post-marketing data of adverse events from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. A significant positive correlation was revealed in 7677 patients between the reporting odds ratio of irAEs during immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and the corresponding tumor mutational burden across 19 cancer types.

These 3D liver models can recapitulate the architecture, functionality and toxicity response of the native liver, demonstrated by a set of related hallmarks. In this comprehensive review, non-scaffold and scaffold-based methods available for 3D liver model formation are introduced, with an emphasis on their advantages and drawbacks. We then focus on the characteristics of primary human hepatocytes, stem cell derived hepatocyte like cells, and immortalized hepatic cell lines as cell resources for model reconstruction. Primary hepatocytes are generally regarded to be superior to other cell types due to their comparable metabolic profiles to the native liver. Additionally, the application of 3D liver models (mostly liver spheroids) on the evaluation of drug induced liver injury and chronic liver diseases (steatosis, cirrhosis, cholestasis), as well as the potential of nanomaterials to introduce hepatotoxicity are summarized. Finally, the global 3D cell market from 3D liver model manufacturing to the contract service of in vitro hepatotoxicity testing using the models is extensively explored. However, 3D liver models face cultural and regulatory barriers in different countries, and therefore the business development of 3D liver models is not easy. Toxicologists, material scientists, engineers should work together to develop, validate and apply 3D liver models for hepatotoxicity testing under the support from industrial organizations and governmental agencies. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate; acetic acid derivative; agarose; amiodarone; amitriptyline; benzo[a]pyrene; bile acid; bosentan; chlorpromazine; clozapine; cyclosporine; diclofenac; fialuridine; flutamide; galactosamine; herbaceous agent; isoniazid; loratadine; methotrexate; nanofiber; nanomaterial; nanomesh; paracetamol; propranolol; proteoglycan; tetracycline; tolcapone; troglitazone; trovafloxacin; CA3 cell line; cell adhesion; chronic liver disease; drug cytotoxicity; drug industry; encapsulation; extracellular matrix; fatty liver; hanging drop method; Hep-G2 cell line; HepaRG cell line; human; immortalized cell line; in vitro study; lithography; liver cell; liver cell line; liver cirrhosis; liver toxicity; magnetic three dimensional culture; marketing; microfluidics; micromolding; nonhuman; plane surface method; primary cell; Review; spheroid cell; stem cell; three dimensional model; three dimensional printing; toxic hepatitis; toxicity testing; adverse drug reaction; biological model; liver; three-dimensional imaging; toxic hepatitis; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Hepatocytes; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Liver; Models, Biological; Toxicity Tests","Taylor and Francis Ltd",Review,Scopus

Blinatumomab was authorized to treat relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL, and the change concerned an extension of use. On March 29, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to blinatumomab to treat both adults and children with B-cell precursor ALL who are in remission but still have MRD. On July 26, 2018, the CHMP had originally adopted a negative opinion on the extension. The reason for the initial refusal was that although blinatumomab helped to reduce the amount of residual cancer cells in many patients, there was no strong evidence that it led to improved survival. During the re-examination, the CHMP consulted the scientific advisory group. The CHMP agreed with the expert group's conclusion that, although there was no strong evidence of patients living longer, the available data from the main study (MT103-203) indicated a good durable response to blinatumomab, with an overall complete response rate for the primary endpoint full analysis set (defined as all subjects with an Ig or T-cell receptor polymerase chain reaction MRD assay with the minimum required sensitivity of 1 × 10–4 at central lab established at baseline [n = 113]) as 79.6% (90/113; 95% confidence interval, 71.0–86.6), with a median time to complete MRD response of 29.0 days (range, 5–71). Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the benefits of blinatumomab outweigh its risks and recommended granting the change to the marketing authorization. The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, following reassessment, considered that significant benefit continued to be met and recommended maintaining the orphan designation and thus 10 years market exclusivity (the Orphan Designation is a legal procedure that allows for the designation of a medicinal substance with therapeutic potential for a rare disease, before its first administration in humans or during its clinical development). The marketing authorization holder for this medicinal product is Amgen Europe B.V.

Furthermore, in light of the recent mandate from the Food and Drug Administration restricting the marketing and direct indication of acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) in breast reconstruction, we sought to highlight the overall safety and efficacy demonstrated in the existing literature surrounding all alloplastic materials in nipple–areola complex reconstruction. In this study, the authors conduct a systematic review and pooled outcomes analysis on allogenic and alloplastic implant materials utilized to achieve long-lasting nipple projection stratified by specific material used and respective outcomes. Methods: A comprehensive systematic review on allogenic and synthetic materials data utilized in nipple reconstruction was conducted utilizing Medline/PubMed database. Articles were stratified by (1) alloplastic material, as well as (2) objective and patient-reported outcomes. Results: A total of 592 nipple–areola complexes on 482 patients were featured in 15 case series. In all studies, alloplastic or allograft material was utilized to achieve and maintain nipple projection. Subjective measurements revealed a patient satisfaction rate of 93.3% or higher with the majority of patients being very satisfied with their reconstruction. The alloplastic and allograft implants analyzed had an overall complication rate of 5.3% across all materials used. The most common complication reported was flap or graft necrosis with a pooled rate of 2.5%. Overall, the Ceratite implant presented with the highest complication rate (18%) including flap/graft necrosis (13%) and extrusion of the artificial bone (5%). Other rigid implants such as the biodesign nipple reconstruction cylinder reported complications of extrusion (3.6%), projection loss requiring revision (2.5%), wound dehiscence/drainage (1.5%), flap or graft necrosis (1.0%) and excessive bleeding (0.5%). ADM implants had reported complications of both insufficient projection (0.8%) and excessive projection (1.6%), which required surgical revision. Injectable materials had minimal reported complications of pain during injection (0.8%) with Radiesse and a false-positive PET scan result (0.8%) with DermaLive. Conclusions: Allogeneic and alloplastic grafts are a reliable means of achieving satisfactory nipple projection, with a relatively low overall complication profile. The use of Ceratite (artificial bone) led to the highest complication rates. Further clinical studies are necessary to better understand the feasibility and longer-term outcomes of the use of allogeneic and synthetic augmentation grafts to improve nipple projection.

An article in the 16 August 2019 issue of Science sounds an alarm against such developments. The authors Douglas Sipp and Margaret Sleeboom-Faulkner deprecate at length the reform proposal of my Free To Choose Medicine (hereafter FTCM; see Madden 2018), which served as a model for Japan’s legislation authorizing conditional approval for medical treatments focused on regenerative medicine (e.g., stem cells). FTCM enables patients, advised by their doctors, to make informed decisions about early access to new drugs after successful completion of initial safety and efficacy trials. Although Sipp and Sleeboom-Faulkner are on solid ground in recognizing some unscientific use of stem cells via direct-to-consumer marketing, they are, I think, wrong in supposing that Japan’s conditional approval will hurt patients by enabling them to gain early access to regenerative medicine treatments. Their judgments are not substantiated by evidence or argumentation about the merits and demerits of the reform; they simply assume that the liberalization is a bad thing. Their article is about 2,900 words in length and appears in Science, one of the top-five most cited journals, so it merits a response. I submitted an earlier version of the present article to Science, but it was dismissively turned away. Sipp and Sleeboom-Faulkner give a fair amount of attention to my work and its influence, writing: the key principles adopted in Japan’s deregulation of regenerative medicine were previously outlined by a free-market policy institute, the Illinois-based Heartland Institute, in the form of a book-length proposal titled Free to Choose Medicine (FTCM)… it is an important illustration of how attempts by private policy groups in one country may influence lawmaking in another, with consequences that may be disadvantageous to the publics they are intended to serve. (Sipp and Sleeboom-Faulkner 2019, 645) In Japan, FTCM found more fertile ground. An early version of the proposal was translated into Japanese by the president of the free-market organization Japanese for Tax Reform, who proceeded to lobby it to members of the Japanese government. (ibid.) In 2012, the Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine began to call for regulatory reforms aimed at accelerating approvals through revisiting clinical testing standards. By 2013, mentions of FTCM began to appear in presentations made by staff in Japan’s drug regulatory agency, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. The same year, the conditional approvals pathway for regenerative medicine products was introduced. The author of FTCM has since thanked the translator for helping to make his ideas into law in Japan. (ibid., 646) Sipp and Sleeboom-Faulkner do not treat liberal economic reasonings with respect, speaking of such reasoning as subservience to “economic agendas, cloaked in the language of serving patients” (2019, 646), as though I do not sincerely believe that liberalization would significantly benefit humankind.

Although cell-based therapy has the potential to improve the treatment of disorders of the musculoskeletal system, there is also the possibility of misuse and misrepresentation of the efficacy of such treatments. The medical literature contains anecdotal reports and research studies, along with web-based marketing and patient testimonials supporting cell-based therapy. Both the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) and the Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS) are committed to ensuring that the potential of cell-based therapies is realized through rigorous, reproducible, and clinically meaningful scientific discovery. The two organizations convened a multidisciplinary and international Task Force composed of physicians, surgeons, and scientists who are recognized experts in the development and use of cell-based therapies. The Task Force was charged with defining the state-of-the art in cell-based therapies and identifying the gaps in knowledge and methodologies that should guide the research agenda. The efforts of this Task Force are designed to provide researchers and clinicians with a better understanding of the current state of the science and research needed to advance the study and use of cell-based therapies for skeletal tissues. The design and implementation of rigorous, thorough protocols will be critical to leveraging these innovative treatments and optimizing clinical and functional patient outcomes. In addition to providing specific recommendations and ethical considerations for preclinical and clinical investigations, this report concludes with an outline to address knowledge gaps in how to determine the cell autonomous and nonautonomous effects of a donor population used for bone regeneration. © 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

However, the automatic detection of decayed citrus is still a challenge. Early decay of citrus happen on surface peel and present a obvious symptom of water-soaked with cell tissue collapse, which may offer the feasibility of transmittance imaging mode to detect decayed region of citrus. In this study, image processing methods including principal component analysis (PCA), pseudo-color image transformation technology and improved watershed segmentation algorithms (IWSA) were employed to analyze the feasibility of decay detection based on the scanned hyperspectral transmittance images (325−1098 nm) of sound and decayed oranges. The results show that PC3 image is promising for decay segmentation. G components extracted from pseudo-color images of PC3 were selected to enhance image contrasts between decayed and sound tissues, and then decayed regions were segmented perfectly by IWSA whether the defects located on the edge or center position of oranges. However, stem-end tissue had similar features with decayed tissue and therefore were easily misidentified as decayed tissues for those decayed samples with stem-end tissue, and so stem-end identification was carried out. PC2 image and R components extracted from pseudo-color images of PC2 were promising for stem-end identification, then IWSA and morphological parameters were used to extract stem-end region. The stem-end was marked in both operations of decay segmentation and stem-end identification, hence decayed region were further determined for eliminating the misclassification interference of stem-end tissue on decay detection by removing the stem-end region from the operation of decay segmentation. For a validation set including of 84 decayed and 66 sound fruit, the success rates were 93 % and 96 %, respectively, and 94 % for decayed, sound and all fruit. Hyperspectral transmittance imaging offers a novel method for automatic detection of early decayed orange caused by fungus. © 2019",,"Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

About 40 years after its marketing in Europe, once demonstrated its efficacy and safety, metformin was registered also in the U.S. A few years later, it has become a mainstay in T2DM treatment, according to all international Scientific Societies guidelines. Today, despite the advent of new innovative drugs, metformin still persists as a first-choice drug in T2DM. This success is largely justified. In fact, over the years, also positive effects on health increased. In particular, evidence has been accumulated on a beneficial impact against many other aging-related morbidities (obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, cancer, cognitive decline and mortality). This literature review describes preclinical and clinical evidence favoring the “anti-aging” therapeutic potential of metformin outside of T2DM. The rationale to the use of metformin as part of a combined therapy in a variety of clinical settings, allowing for a reduction of the chemotherapy dose in cancer patients, has also been discussed. In particular, the focus was on metformin action on RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway.

On June 28, 2018, the Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Kymriah for pediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse after transplant, or in second or later relapse and for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Kymriah became one of the first European Union–approved CAR T therapies. The active substance of Kymriah is tisagenlecleucel, an autologous, immunocellular cancer therapy that involves reprogramming the patient's own T cells to identify and eliminate CD19-expressing cells. This is achieved by addition of a transgene encoding a CAR. The benefit of Kymriah was its ability to achieve remission with a significant duration in patients with ALL and an objective response with a significant duration in patients with DLBCL. The most common hematological toxicity was cytopenia in both patients with ALL and those with DLBCL. Nonhematological side effects in patients with ALL were cytokine release syndrome (CRS), infections, secondary hypogammaglobulinemia due to B-cell aplasia, pyrexia, and decreased appetite. The most common nonhematological side effects in patients with DLBCL were CRS, infections, pyrexia, diarrhea, nausea, hypotension, and fatigue. Kymriah also received an orphan designation on April 29, 2014, following a positive recommendation by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP). Maintenance of the orphan designation was recommended at the time of marketing authorization as the COMP considered the product was of significant benefit for patients with both conditions. Implications for Practice: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)–engineered T-cell therapy is becoming the most promising approach in cancer treatment, involving reprogramming the patient's own T cells with a CAR-encoding transgene to identify and eliminate cancer-specific surface antigen–expressing cells. On June 28, 2018, Kymriah became one of the first EMA approved CAR T therapies. CAR T technology seems highly promising for diseases with single genetic/protein alterations; however, for more complex diseases there will be challenges to target clonal variability within the tumor type or clonal evolution during disease progression. Products with a lesser toxicity profile or more risk-minimization tools are also anticipated. © AlphaMed Press 2019","CD19 antigen; CD20 antigen; chimeric antigen receptor; cisplatin; cyclophosphamide; cytarabine; doxorubicin; elongation factor 1alpha; etoposide; gemcitabine; prednisone; protein bcl 2; protein bcl 6; rituximab; tisagenlecleucel T; tocilizumab; vincristine; lymphocyte antigen receptor; tisagenlecleucel T; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; anemia; antineoplastic activity; aplasia; Article; bone marrow depression; cytokine release; cytokine release syndrome; cytopenia; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; drug efficacy; drug safety; echocardiography; European Medicines Agency; follicular lymphoma; follow up; heart disease; hypotension; immunoglobulin deficiency; minimal residual disease; myelodysplastic syndrome; nausea; plasmid; priority journal; quality of life; questionnaire; relapse; salvage therapy; stem cell transplantation; survival rate; T lymphocyte activation; transgene; woodchuck hepatitis; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adoptive immunotherapy; child; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; genetics; human; Child; Humans; Immunotherapy, Adoptive; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell; Receptors, Chimeric Antigen","Wiley-Blackwell",Article,Scopus

Although these technologies are in relatively early stages of development, there have been substantial increases in marketing, patient demand, and clinical utilization of biologics, including platelet-rich plasma, bone marrow aspirate concentrate, and other cell-derived therapies. Direct-to-consumer marketing of biologics has also proliferated but is largely unregulated, and clinicians must accurately convey the safety and efficacy profiles of these therapies to patients. Because most insurance companies consider biologic treatments to be experimental or investigational for orthopaedic applications given the lack of high-quality evidence to support their efficacy, patients receiving these treatments often make substantial out-of-pocket payments. With a range of treatment costs among centers offering biologics, there is a need for appropriate and sustainable pricing and reimbursement models. Clinicians utilizing biologics must also have a thorough understanding of the recently clarified Food and Drug Administration guidelines that regulate the clinical use of cell and tissue products. There is a lack of consensus on the optimal preparation, source, delivery method, and dosing of biologic therapies, which has been exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in most published studies.

Targeted approaches (i.e. ibrutinib, bortezomib, and lenalidomide) represent the backbone of therapy for relapsed cases. Areas covered: Acalabrutinib is a novel small molecule with a butynamide moiety specifically designed to irreversibly inhibit Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), which is more potent and selective than ibrutinib. Relevant publications have been identified through literature searches using the terms ‘mantle cell lymphoma’ and ‘acalabrutinib’. Expert opinion: Acalabrutinib has been approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory (RR) MCL patients. To date, clinical trials have reported some adverse effects such as cardiac toxicity or atrial fibrillation. Acalabrutinib in combination with other drugs, either in chemo-containing or chemo-free schedules, represent a valid option for MCL. However, none of the treatment schedules containing BTK inhibitors have been shown to be curative in MCL. Acalabrutinib may ultimately represent an option for patients who are ‘fit’ and exhibit well-controlled disease, which often characterizes only a limited ‘niche’ among MCL patients. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","acalabrutinib; lenalidomide; temsirolimus; zanubrutinib; acalabrutinib; antineoplastic agent; benzamide derivative; BTK protein, human; protein kinase inhibitor; pyrazine derivative; Article; cancer resistance; drug marketing; drug safety; drug screening; human; mantle cell lymphoma; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); mantle cell lymphoma; Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase; Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Benzamides; Humans; Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Pyrazines","Taylor and Francis Ltd",Article,Scopus

Up to 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a mutation in the FLT3 receptor. Molecular targets have acquired a significant interest in the treatment of AML and are changing patient outcomes, including improvement of overall survival (OS) and remission rates. FLT3 inhibitors have obtained a central role in how we treat AML. Areas covered:. This article reviews the mechanism of action, pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and safety of quizartinib, a FLT3 inhibitor, for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Expert opinion:. Quizartinib yielded an improvement in OS and complete remission (CR) rates in a phase 3 trial for relapsed/refractory FLT3-mutated AML. The toxicities are manageable; however, it is associated with significant QTc prolongation and myelosuppression. The FDA and EMA did not grant drug approval to quizartinib in the relapsed/refractory setting due to the lack of a significant benefit–to-risk ratio, safety concerns and concerns with credibility and generalizability of the trial data. Results from the frontline phase 3 study evaluating quizartinib with intensive chemotherapy are eagerly awaited.

The ability of stem cells to regenerate and reconstruct the damaged tissue makes them an exciting area in medical treatment. Stem cell and stem cell-based products are used in the treatment of many diseases and support therapies. In India, the stem cell and cell-based products are supervised by the Central Drug Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. CDSCO regulates the clinical trial approvals, monitoring, and approvals of drug manufacturing or new drugs and marketing authorization of stem cell-based products under the Drugs and Cosmetic Act 1940 and Rules.

In 2018, the European Medicines Agency finally granted the first marketing authorization for an MSC product. Despite the numerous promising results in preclinical studies, translation into routine practice still lags behind: therapeutic benefits of MSCs are not as satisfactory in clinical trial settings as they appear to be in preclinical models. The bench-to-bedside-and-back approach and careful evaluation of discrepancies between preclinical and clinical results have provided valuable insights into critical components of MSC manufacturing, their mechanisms of action, and how to evaluate and quality-control them. We sum up these past developments in the introductory section (“Mesenchymal stromal cells: name follows function”). From the huge amount of information, we then selected a few examples to illustrate challenges and opportunities to improve MSCs for clinical purposes. These include tissue origin of MSCs, MSC culture conditions, immune compatibility, and route of application and dosing. Finally, we add some information on MSC mechanisms of action and translation into potency assays and give an outlook on future perspectives raising the question of whether the future clinical product may be cell-based or cell-derived. © 2020 Rendra E et al.","exosome; human; human cell; human tissue; mesenchymal stroma cell; preclinical study; quality control; review; biological therapy; cell culture technique; cytology; mesenchymal stem cell; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cells","F1000 Research Ltd",Review,Scopus

In spite of substantial progress in the field, manufacturing of cell-based therapies presents multiple challenges that need to be addressed in order to assure the development of safe, efficacious, and cost-effective cell therapies. The manufacturing process of cell-based therapies generally requires tissue collection, cell isolation, culture and expansion (upstream processing), cell harvest, separation and purification (downstream processing), and, finally, product formulation and storage. Each one of these stages presents significant challenges that have been the focus of study over the years, leading to innovative and groundbreaking technological advances, as discussed throughout this chapter. Delivery of cell-based therapies relies on defining product targets while controlling process variable impact on cellular features. Moreover, commercial viability is a critical issue that has had damaging consequences for some therapies. Implementation of cost-effectiveness measures facilitates healthy process development, potentially being able to influence end product pricing. Although cell-based therapies represent a new level in bioprocessing complexity in every manufacturing stage, they also show unprecedented levels of therapeutic potential, already radically changing the landscape of medical care. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","biological therapy; cell culture technique; cell separation; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Separation; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy","Springer",Book Chapter,Scopus

The medical literature contains anecdotal reports and research studies, along with web-based marketing and patient testimonials supporting cell-based therapy. Both the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) and the Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS) are committed to ensuring that the potential of cell-based therapies is realized through rigorous, reproducible, and clinically meaningful scientific discovery. The two organizations convened a multidisciplinary and international Task Force composed of physicians, surgeons, and scientists who are recognized experts in the development and use of cell-based therapies. The Task Force was charged with defining the state-of-the art in cell-based therapies and identifying the gaps in knowledge and methodologies that should guide the research agenda. The efforts of this Task Force are designed to provide researchers and clinicians with a better understanding of the current state of the science and research needed to advance the study and use of cell-based therapies for skeletal tissues. The design and implementation of rigorous, thorough protocols will be critical to leveraging these innovative treatments and optimizing clinical and functional patient outcomes.

To meet this area of unmet need, a wave of regenerative medicine therapies, including stem cells and other cell-based therapies, is currently in clinical development and anticipated to inundate the global market over the next few years. Although intended to be transformative, orthopedic cell therapies face several practical opportunities and challenges. Such therapies could reduce the health care burden, in part by replacing traditional drug therapies and highly-invasive surgical interventions with single-dose treatments. However, therapy developers and providers must address hurdles from regulatory to reimbursement to commercial challenges before successful orthopedic cell therapies are available to patients. Regulatory policies, reimbursement processes, and commercial requirements for orthopedic cell therapies differ across markets, and key health care stakeholders must address these differences well before a product launch. Pricing and reimbursement models for innovative therapies, like cell-based therapies in orthopedics, grow unclear, especially how health care systems will absorb potentially transformative and highly-needed, but costly, therapies. Single administration therapies with relatively high upfront cost require more evidence to support their value for pricing and reimbursement than other health care products, and orthopedic cell therapies must do so based on patient quality of life and health care resource use, as opposed to improved survival, which is especially challenging. In addition, alternative financing and reimbursement models may be needed to support ongoing patient access and innovation.

In addition, we retrospectively compared these to another 13 PBSC donors mobilized with the originator filgrastim in the same period. Donor characteristics were equivalent between the groups. The median number of CD34+ cells per donor body weight (BW) and blood volume processed (BV) were 4.87 × 106/kg and 25.5 × 103/mL in the biosimilar group and 4.93 × 106/kg and 16.6 × 103/mL in the originator group, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups in the number of CD34+ cells per donor BW or BV. All adverse events associated with G-CSF were permissive. The total G-CSF cost was significantly lower in the biosimilar group than in the originator group.

The authorization concerns the use of allogeneic adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for treatment of complex perianal fistulas in Crohn's disease. This is a breakthrough in the field of MSC therapy. The last few years have, furthermore, seen some breakthroughs in the investigations into the mechanisms of action of MSC therapy. Although the therapeutic effects of MSCs have largely been attributed to their secretion of immunomodulatory and regenerative factors, it has now become clear that some of the effects are mediated through host phagocytic cells that clear administered MSCs and in the process adapt an immunoregulatory and regeneration supporting function. The increased interest in therapeutic use of MSCs and the ongoing elucidation of the mechanisms of action of MSCs are promising indicators that 2019 may be the dawn of the therapeutic era of MSCs and that there will be revived interest in research to more efficient, practical, and sustainable MSC-based therapies.

Plenty of cell line as well as animal research have reported the anti-hyperglycaemic activity of the drug. Even though quality researches are necessary to fulfil further human studies and marketing, no quality assessments for these studies have been undertaken till date. The aim was to critically analyse the quality standards and evaluate the anti-hyperglycaemic potential of A. marmeloes in rodent model researches. The search strategy was done using the key words ‘Aegle marmelos, along with ‘Diabetes or Hyperglycaemia,’ in different databases like PubMed (n = 45), Google Scholar (n = 43) and Science Direct (n = 46). However, the filter used during the search was ‘Animal experimentation’. All animal experimentations collected with the keyword search was analysed for the inclusion criteria like serum glucose estimation as primary outcome, timeline of publication 1997 to 2017 in English and treatments containing any part and any form of A. marmelos in single or in combination. Based on the inclusion criteria, 11 articles were selected for the review. Data extraction underwent a blind procedure independently by two reviewers. If full texts were not available, communicating the authors was also tried and all the four authors responded. All the studies selected after screening were given unique codes, to ensure blind review. Result observed indicated higher reduction of serum glucose levels in hyperglycaemia-induced rodent models. After administering the drug, significant changes were observed in total cholesterol as well as triglycerides. Rest of the LDL, HDL, SOD and serum insulin were an in-significant find. Sample size calculation was not mentioned in any of the studies. Only 9% of the studies reported on blinding and 18% reported on randomisation. This might have affected the internal validity of the studies. It can be concluded that A. marmelos is effective in lowering the serum glucose levels in experimental hyperglycaemia. Further research has to be conducted to explore its target specific mode of action. This may lead to the development of an effective anti-hyperglycaemic drug with minimal side effects. © 2019, Informatics Publishing Limited.

Macaca fascicularis monkeys from Mauritius have a low genetic diversity and are particularly useful for reproducible drug testing. In particular, they have a genetically homogeneous class I major histocompatibility complex system that probably mitigates the variability of the response to simian immunodeficiency virus infection. However, the transduction of simian cells with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-derived vectors is inefficient due to capsid-specific restriction factors, such as the tripartite motif-containing protein tripartite motif 5α, which prevent infection with non-host-adapted retroviruses. This study introduced the modified capsid of the macaque-trophic HIV-1 clone MN4/LSQD into the packaging system and compared transduction efficiencies between hematopoietic cells transduced with this construct and cells transduced with HIV-1 NL4-3-derived packaging constructs. Capsid modification increased transduction efficiency in all hematopoietic cells tested (by factors of up to 10), including hematopoietic progenitor cells, repopulating cells, and T cells from Mauritian Macaca fascicularis, regardless of vector structure or purification method. The study also established culture conditions similar to those used in clinical practice for the efficient transduction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor CD34+ cells. These results suggest that the procedure is suitable for use in Mauritian Macaca fascicularis, which can therefore be used as a model in preclinical studies for hematopoietic gene and cell therapy. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","lentivirus vector; biological marker; CD34 antigen; tripartite motif protein; ubiquitin protein ligase; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; cell growth; hematopoietic stem cell; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Macaca fascicularis; male; NIH 3T3 cell line; nonhuman; T lymphocyte; virus capsid; animal; chemistry; female; gene expression; gene vector; genetic transduction; genetics; hematopoietic stem cell; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; immunology; Macaca fascicularis; metabolism; mouse; nonobese diabetic mouse; procedures; transplantation; virology; xenograft; Animals; Antigens, CD34; Biomarkers; Capsid; Female; Gene Expression; Genetic Vectors; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; HIV-1; Macaca fascicularis; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred NOD; T-Lymphocytes; Transduction, Genetic; Transplantation, Heterologous; Tripartite Motif Proteins; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases","Mary Ann Liebert Inc.",Article,Scopus

The current study investigates the scope of “cell therapy” clinics across the U.S. that advertise and offer “cell therapy” for ocular conditions based on information provided on their websites. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: The study included companies that are U.S.-based, participate in direct-to-consumer online marketing, have websites that can be data-mined with content analysis, and advertise therapy for ocular conditions. Methods: Using a systematic, extensive keyword-based Internet search, content analysis of company websites was utilized to identify, document, and analyze U.S. businesses marketing “cell therapy” for ocular conditions as of September 16, 2017. Main Outcome Measures: Clinic locations, source of stem cells used, route of administration, marketed ocular conditions, and cost of treatment. Results: Forty companies with 76 clinics use “cell therapy” to treat ocular conditions. California (23), Florida (12), and Illinois (10) contain the most clinics. All 40 companies specified sources of cells, which included autologous adipose-derived stem cells (35; 67%), autologous bone marrow–derived stem cells (8; 15%), amniotic stem cells (2; 4%), peripheral blood–derived stem cells (2; 4%), umbilical cord blood stem cells (2; 4%), allogenic bone marrow–derived stem cells (1; 2%), placental stem cells (1; 2%), and xenocells (1; 2%). The most commonly marketed ocular conditions included macular degeneration (35), optic neuritis (18), retinitis pigmentosa (17), and diabetic retinopathy (16). The most common routes of administration were intravenous (22) and “unspecified” (12); however, other companies listed more ocular-specific routes such as intravitreal injections (2), retrobulbar injections (2), eye injections (2), retrofundal injection (1), sub-Tenon injection (1), intraocular injection with vitrectomy (1), and eye drops (1). The cost of advertised “cell therapy” ranged from $4000 to $10 500. Conclusions: “Cell therapy” for ocular conditions is readily available via direct-to-consumer marketing strategies across the United States. The “cells” are harvested from numerous sources and administered through different methods for multiple ocular conditions at these “cell therapy” clinics. Limited data for these treatments necessitates advocating caution to physicians and patients about treatments offered at commercial “cell therapy” clinics. © 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology","adipose derived stem cell; amniotic fluid stem cell; autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; autologous stem cell transplantation; commercial phenomena; Conference Paper; content analysis; cross-sectional study; data mining; diabetic retinopathy; direct-to-consumer advertizing; geography; health care cost; human; Internet; macular degeneration; optic neuritis; peripheral blood stem cell transplantation; placental stem cell; priority journal; retinitis pigmentosa; stem cell; stem cell transplantation; umbilical cord blood; United States; biological therapy; eye disease; outpatient department; procedures; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Direct-to-Consumer Advertising; Eye Diseases; Humans; Internet; United States","Elsevier Inc.",Conference Paper,Scopus

Several phase I and II clinical trials are being conducted owing to positive results obtained in animal models. While safety during the trials has been demonstrated, clinical efficacy in the outcome of ethically approved trials is still lacking. Many persons affected by SCI are, however, desperate for a cure and are lured into undergoing stem cell therapy by marketing campaigns and information readily available on the internet. These people travel far and wide to undergo stem cell therapy, which has led to the term 'stem cell tourism'. Objectives. To compare the data from participants' self-report questionnaires before and after their stem cell therapy to determine if there were differences in their functional and neurological status, and to record details of the procedures. Method. Persons who sustained a SCI and who received apparent stem cell therapy in South Africa (SA) or elsewhere were recruited to participate in the present study. Volunteers who gave written informed consent were asked to complete a biographical questionnaire and validated self-report questionnaire (Spinal Cord Independence Measure version III (SCIM III)) before and after their stem cell therapy to determine if there were differences in their functional and neurological status. The results of the self-report questionnaires were compared with the published expected functional outcome of people with lesions at a similar level of SCI to the participants. The secondary aims of the study were to document details of the procedures and their locations, the sources of 'stem cells' and the cost. Results. There was no indication that the participants' functional outcomes, as measured by the self-reported SCIM III, were better than the expected level of functional ability in patients with similar injury levels. Likewise, the neurological motor recovery scored on the International Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) motor scores showed no improvement post stem cell therapy. Conclusion. This study highlights the need to curb the practice of offering unethical and non-evidence-based stem cell therapy for SCI. Ethical research and treatment is encouraged as well as an effective legal framework and education of health professionals, patients and their family members and caregivers, which will avoid unrealistic expectations, bogus therapies and the potential adverse effects of non-evidence-based 'stem cell therapies' offered by clinics via the internet.",,"NLM (Medline)",Article,Scopus

There is little evidence supporting their use and they have been associated with a range of harms. Canada has been slower to act against clinics offering these interventions than other jurisdictions, including the United States. Here, we outline the regulatory and policy tools available in Canada to address this growing problem. Main body: Health Canada's regulations governing cell therapies are complex, but recent statements make it clear that Health Canada believes it has jurisdiction over many of the currently marketed stem cell interventions. Still, further regulatory clarity is needed from Health Canada, as are increased directed enforcement efforts on interventions that fall within their scope. The Competition Bureau, via the Competition Act, prohibits advertisers from making materially false or misleading promotional representations. The Competition Bureau could collaborate with the scientific community to analyze the claims of existing clinics in Canada, and impose sanctions upon those who breach the established standard. Professional regulators, including provincial colleges of physicians and surgeons, have considerable power over what products and services their members can offer. Every college of physicians in Canada requires, via policy and codes of ethics, that doctors maintain evidence-based practices. This requirement is incompatible with offering many unproven stem cell interventions. Litigation may be another tool, including the use of fraud, misrepresentation and/or negligence claims for failing to meet the required standard of care. Finally, political pressure on federal and provincial lawmakers could encourage changes to marketing, cell therapy and professional regulations that would allow a more comprehensive response. Conclusions: In sum, there are many existing tools that can be used to protect the public from unproven stem cell interventions. Increased bureaucratic will and grassroots efforts are needed in order to effect a positive policy response. © 2019 The Author(s).","article; cell therapy; college; competition; fraud; Health Canada; health care quality; human; human cell; law suit; marketing; medical ethics; negligence; stem cell; surgeon; advertising; Canada; ethics; government regulation; health care policy; jurisprudence; legislation and jurisprudence; stem cell transplantation; treatment outcome; Advertising; Canada; Government Regulation; Health Policy; Humans; Jurisprudence; Stem Cell Transplantation; Treatment Outcome","BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Areas covered: Organs-on-chips (OOCs) are emerging, cutting edge microphysiology systems for in vitro production of microengineered three-dimensional, miniature organotypic constructs obtained by cultivating small amounts of human primary, or induced pluripotent stem, cells in native-like microhabitats. These preparations circumvent experimental limitations inherent to animal assays and two-dimensional monolayers, the mainstay core biological assays of traditional drug research. This report reviews the fundamental tenets, key components (chip plate, biomaterials, cell differentiation approaches, and monitoring sensors) and issues concerning OOC systems (engineered top-down and bottom-up strategies for tissue/organ assembly, public aids to OOC development, regulatory validation, advantages, limitations, prospective and perspective of OOCs, ethics). Examples of OOC platforms (cancer-, lung-, blood-brain barrier-, heart-, intestine-, kidney-, liver-, pharmacokinetics-, placenta and vessel-on-chip) and their importance for drug research and development are presented. Expert opinion: OOC device-generated bioconstructs hold great promise as experimental human tissue and organ platforms for generating human-pertinent knowledge on drug candidates for clinical assessment and reducing reliance on animal models.

However, data from clinical studies are not robust. Despite lack of substantial evidence for the efficacy of these interventions in spinal cord injury (SCI), many clinics around the world offer them as “therapy.” These “clinics” claim efficacy through patient testimonials and self-advertisement without any scientific evidence to validate their claims. Thus, SCS established a panel of experts to review published preclinical studies, clinical studies and current global guidelines/regulations on usage of cellular transplants and make recommendations for their clinical use. Methods: The literature review and draft position statement was compiled and circulated among the panel and relevant suggestions incorporated to reach consensus. This was discussed and finalized in an open forum during the SCS Annual Meeting, ISSICON. Results: Preclinical evidence suggests safety and clinical potency of cellular interventions after SCI. However, evidence from clinical studies consisted of mostly case reports or uncontrolled case series/studies. Data from animal studies cannot be generalized to human SCI with regard to toxicity prediction after auto/allograft transplantation. Conclusions: Currently, cellular/stem cell transplantation for human SCI is experimental and needs to be tested through a valid clinical trial program. It is not ethical to provide unproven transplantation as therapy with commercial implications. To stop the malpractice of marketing such “unproven therapies” to a vulnerable population, it is crucial that all countries unite to form common, well-defined regulations/legislation on their use in SCI.

Therapeutic infusion of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is now a leading investigational strategy for the treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Bone marrow MSCs are approved for manufacture and marketing as a cell therapy for aGVHD. Our non-clinical studies confirmed that human amnion-derived MSCs had immunomodulatory activity equal to or higher than that of human bone marrow MSCs. This study will aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of amnion-derived MSCs (AM01) in patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD. Methods and analysis: This study will be a multicentre, single-arm, open-label trial (an interventional study). This clinical trial will begin with a low-dose group, and when safety has been confirmed in at least three cases in the low-dose group, treatment will begin for the high-dose group, for which the safety will also be verified. The primary endpoint is to assess the safety of intravenous infusion therapy of AM01 within 24 hours after intravenous infusion of AM01. The secondary endpoint is to explore the efficacy of intravenous infusion therapy with AM01. Ethics and dissemination: The institutional review boards of all participating hospitals approved this study protocol (latest V3.3.0, 3 August 2018). Final data will be publicly announced. A report releasing the study results will be submitted for publication to an appropriate peer-reviewed journal. © 2019 Author(s).","am 01; corticosteroid; cyclosporine; dexchlorpheniramine maleate; hydrocortisone sodium succinate; methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; succizone; tacrolimus; thymocyte antibody; unclassified drug; acute graft versus host disease; adult; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; amnion cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; clinical article; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; drug efficacy; drug megadose; drug safety; human; human cell; infusion therapy; Japanese (people); low drug dose; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; multicenter study; nonhuman; open study; patient safety; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; SCID mouse; steroid therapy; unspecified side effect; adolescent; adverse event; aged; amnion; clinical trial; cytology; female; graft versus host reaction; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Japan; male; mesenchymal stem cell; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; middle aged; time factor; transplantation; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Amnion; Female; Graft vs Host Disease; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Japan; Male; Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Middle Aged; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","BMJ Publishing Group",Article,Scopus

For both clinicians and patients it is considered a highly attractive therapeutic approach associated with a high degree of innovation. Nevertheless, the field of cell therapy does not seem to be unproblematic. Thus, cell and tissue therapeutic agents are controlled in Germany by the regulation for drugs for advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP) and there is a wide heterogeneity in the possibilities of application. In addition, the currently available limited scientific evidence is difficult to classify. It is not only against this background that, from the authors’ point of view, controlled studies with specific questions need to be performed before these therapeutic approaches are offered to patients in the daily routine.

This research analyzed how illness-related crowdfunding and crowdfunding campaigns have recently been represented in newspapers that are popular in the United States and Canada. Methods A sample of 336 articles about medical crowdfunding published during the two year time period from October 7, 2015 to October 6, 2017 was produced using a Factiva search of the English language newspapers with the largest Canadian and United States readership. A coding frame was developed for and applied to the sample to analyze content. Results Articles portrayed crowdfunding campaigns positively (43.75%) and neutrally (47.92%), but rarely negatively (4.76%). Articles mostly mentioned the crowdfunding phenomenon with a neutral characterization (93.75%). Few (8.63%) articles mentioned ethical issues with the phenomenon of crowdfunding. Ailments most commonly precipitating the need for a campaign included cancer (49.11%) and rare disease (as stated by the article, 36.01%). Most articles (83.04%) note where donations and contributions can be made, and 59.23% included a hyperlink to an online crowdfunding campaign website. Some articles (26.49%) mentioned a specific monetary goal for the fundraising campaign. Of the 70 (20.83%) articles that indicated the treatment sought may be inefficacious, was unproven, was experimental or lacked regulatory approval, 56 (80.00%) noted where contributions can be made and 36 (51.43%) hyperlinked directly to an online crowdfunding campaign. Conclusions Crowdfunding campaigns are portrayed positively much more often than negatively, many articles promote campaigns for unproven therapies, and links directly to crowdfunding campaign webpages are present in most articles. Overall, crowdfunding is often either implicitly or explicitly endorsed. © 2019 Murdoch et al.

Although investment in drug discovery and development has been sky-rocketing, the number of approved drugs has been declining. Cardiovascular toxicity due to therapeutic drug use claims the highest incidence and severity of adverse drug reactions in late-stage clinical development. Therefore, to address this issue, new, additional, replacement and combinatorial approaches are needed to fill the gap in effective drug discovery and screening. The motivation for developing accurate, predictive models is twofold: first, to study and discover new treatments for cardiac pathologies which are leading in worldwide morbidity and mortality rates; and second, to screen for adverse drug reactions on the heart, a primary risk in drug development. In addition to in vivo animal models, in vitro and in silico models have been recently proposed to mimic the physiological conditions of heart and vasculature. Here, we describe current in vitro, in vivo, and in silico platforms for modelling healthy and pathological cardiac tissues and their advantages and disadvantages for drug screening and discovery applications. We review the pathophysiology and the underlying pathways of different cardiac diseases, as well as the new tools being developed to facilitate their study. We finally suggest a roadmap for employing these non-animal platforms in assessing drug cardiotoxicity and safety. © 2019 The Authors","Animals; Cardiology; Diagnosis; Diseases; Heart; Pathology; Pharmacodynamics; Predictive analytics; Stem cells; Cardio-vascular disease; Cardiomyocytes; Disease models; Drug discovery; Human-induced pluripotent stem cells; Organ-on-a-chip; Physiological models; cardiovascular agent; chemokine; cytokine; Article; atherosclerotic plaque; cardiac muscle cell; cardiomyopathy; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular disease; causal attribution; cell differentiation; cell maturation; cell self-renewal; computer model; cost benefit analysis; disease model; drug approval; drug marketing; drug safety; drug screening; heart arrhythmia; heart infarction; heart muscle fibrosis; heart tissue; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; induced pluripotent stem cell; nonhuman; pathophysiology; primary cell culture; priority journal; rabbit model; rodent model; stem cell; thrombosis; tissue engineering; animal; biological model; cardiovascular disease; computer simulation; devices; disease model; drug development; drug effect; equipment design; pathology; preclinical study; procedures; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Computer Simulation; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Discovery; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Equipment Design; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Models, Cardiovascular; Myocytes, Cardiac","Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

As a single agent, blinatumomab has demonstrated significant activity in patients with both relapsed/refractory Philadelphia chromosome-negative and Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease and in patients with persistent MRD. Its unique mechanism of action accounts for its ability to induce durable responses as well as its side effect profile. Areas covered: This manuscript will review the place in therapy for blinatumomab as well as the phase I, phase II, and phase III clinical trials which led to its development and FDA approval for the treatment of ALL. Expert opinion: Blinatumomab is a welcomed addition to the available treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. Furthermore, it is currently the most effective treatment in eradicating MRD, and subsequently allowing patients to proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Improved efficacy is observed in patients treated earlier and in those with lower disease burden, therefore continued evaluation of blinatumomab in combination with chemotherapy in the frontline treatment setting is essential. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","blinatumomab; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; anemia; antineoplastic activity; Article; brain disease; cancer immunotherapy; cytokine release syndrome; drug control; drug efficacy; drug marketing; drug safety; drug tolerability; febrile neutropenia; fever; headache; human; hypertransaminasemia; neurotoxicity; neutropenia; pharmacodynamic parameters; pharmacokinetic parameters; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; seizure","Taylor and Francis Ltd",Article,Scopus

In response to substantial patient demand for biologic treatment of orthopaedic conditions, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons convened a collaborative symposium and established a consensus framework for improving and accelerating the clinical evaluation, use, and optimization of biologic therapies for musculoskeletal diseases. The economic and disease burden of musculoskeletal conditions is high. Of the various conditions discussed, knee osteoarthritis was identified as a ""serious condition"" associated with substantial and progressive morbidity and emerged as the condition with the most urgent need for clinical trial development. It was also recognized that stem cells have unique characteristics that are not met by minimally manipulated mixed cell preparations. The work group recommended that minimally manipulated cell products be referred to as cell therapy and that the untested and uncharacterized nature of these treatments be clearly communicated within the profession, to patients, and to the public. Minimum standards for product characterization and clinical research should also be followed. A framework for developing clinical trials related to knee OA was agreed upon. In addition to recommendations for development of high-quality multicenter clinical trials, another important recommendation was that physicians and institutions offering biologic therapies commit to establishing high-quality patient registries and biorepository-linked registries that can be used for postmarket surveillance and quality assessments. © American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.","biological product; clinical trial (topic); consensus development; drug approval; drug development; human; knee osteoarthritis; methodology; musculoskeletal disease; nomenclature; standards; Biological Products; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Approval; Drug Discovery; Humans; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Research Design; Terminology as Topic","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins",Review,Scopus

Areas covered: The demand for transplantable retinal cells is broad and several cell sources exist that can supply such cells. The recent development of protocols that reprogram adult cells to their pluripotent potential (induced pluripotent stem cells; iPSCs) and the possibility of differentiating iPSCs to many retinal types make these cells very attractive for cell therapeutics in the degenerating retina.iPSCs overcome ethical dilemmas in using fetal cells and with autologous transplantation of iPSC derived retinal cells, immunosuppression will no longer be needed. Importantly, gene editing of iPSCs derived from patients with genetic diseases will allow autologous transplantation of healthy differentiated retinal cells. Expert commentary: Before marketing clinically useful retinal cells, differentiated from iPSCs, a multistep clinical trial is performed. Currently, 23 trials are described in the literature and they report no adverse reactions to cell transplantation. Early visual assessment tests demonstrate small visual benefits in a proportion of participants, with future results anticipated in the near future. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article; cardiac muscle cell; cell differentiation; cell selection; cell survival; electroretinography; fluorescence activated cell sorting; gene editing; HLA matching; human; immunosuppressive treatment; in vitro study; in vivo study; induced pluripotent stem cell transplantation; lymphocyte proliferation; magnetic assisted cell sorting; nonhuman; photoreceptor; retina cell; retina degeneration; somatic cell; stem cell transplantation","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Because many such products have risks, they are typically regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under both sections 351 and 361 of Public Health Services Act. However, a subset of low-risk products that meet FDA criteria have a simplified regulatory path to which only section 361 will apply. Those products can be used clinically without FDA approval. Today many clinics are marketing stem cell and autologous tissue transplants without premarket approval. Some of the interventions violate the regulatory criteria that define the safe harbor for ""361"" products.

ASCs have excellent proliferation, differentiation, and immunoregulatory capacities that have been demonstrated in numerous studies. Great interest and investment have been placed in efforts to exploit the allogeneic use and immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of ASCs. However, bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo studies and moving into clinical practice remain a challenge. For the clinical translation of ASCs, several issues must be considered, including how to characterise such a heterogenic cell population and how to ensure their safety and efficacy. This review explores the different phases of in vitro and preclinical ASC characterisation and describes the development of appropriate potency assays. In addition, good manufacturing practice requirements are discussed, and cell-based medicinal products holding marketing authorisation in the European Union are reviewed. Moreover, the current status of clinical trials applying ASCs and the patent landscape in the field of ASC research are presented. Overall, this review highlights the applicability of ASCs for clinical cell therapies and discusses their potential. Copyright © 2019 Mimmi Patrikoski et al.

Gene therapy is a combination of methods aimed at modifying patient's genetic material: outside the body (ex vivo gene therapy) or when the genetic engineered construct is introduced directly into the human body (in vivo gene therapy). In the legislation of most countries (USA, European Union, Japan, South Korea), products for gene therapy are regulated as biological drugs, whereas in the Russian Federation products for gene therapy in vivo are considered as biological drugs, and for ex vivo therapy - as biomedical cell products. Nowadays, more than 2,800 clinical trials of drugs for gene therapy have been conducted in the world. Regulators authorized 9 drugs for medical use, among which are the drugs for adoptive immunotherapy of blood cancer (Kymriah, Novartis; Yescarta, Kite Pharma, Gilead) based on chimeric antigen receptor technology for patients not responding to standard treatment methods. Development and marketing authorization of the drug Strimvelis (GSK) in the EU is a significant event in gene therapy. Strimvelis is used for the treatment of a genetic disease associated with mutation in the adenosine deaminase gene and leading to severe combined immunodeficiency. In the Russian Federation, to date, only one gene therapy drug, Neovasculgen (JSC Human Stem Cell Institute), based on plasmid DNA, for the treatment of atherosclerotic lower limb ischemia, has been included in the State Register of Medicines (since 2011).

Its persistence in humans after primary infection in a latent phase as well as a partial non–protective immune response is the basis for repeated re-activation/re-infection episodes occurring both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised subjects. In the latter patient populations, which include hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, HCMV reactivation episodes may be particularly severe, leading to both systemic and end-organ diseases. Since the 90s, at least four antiviral drugs targeting the DNA polymerase complex have been developed for the prevention and treatment of HCMV infections in transplant recipients, used as first-line (ganciclovir and valganciclovir) and second-line therapy (foscarnet and cidofovir). However, due to their toxicity and drug-resistance induction, new drugs with different targets were needed. Areas covered: In 2017, a new drug named letermovir (LTV), which targets the HCMV DNA terminase complex, was licensed for prophylaxis of HCMV infections in HSCT recipients. This is the focus of this review. Expert opinion: LTV safety and efficacy are promising. However, long-term adverse events and the emergence of drug-resistant HCMV strains must be investigated in extended clinical trials prior to drawing final conclusions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","antivirus agent; DNA polymerase; letermovir; virus DNA; acetic acid; antivirus agent; cidofovir; ganciclovir; letermovir; quinazoline derivative; valganciclovir; Article; cytomegalovirus infection; drug marketing; drug metabolism; drug safety; drug targeting; drug tolerability; graft recipient; headache; hematopoietic stem cell; human; Human cytomegalovirus; immunocompetence; infection prevention; nausea and vomiting; pharmacodynamics; pharmacokinetic parameters; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); postmarketing surveillance; recipient; severe renal impairment; virus reactivation; virus resistance; antiviral resistance; chemoprophylaxis; Cytomegalovirus; cytomegalovirus infection; drug effect; genetics; immunocompromised patient; procedures; transplantation conditioning; Acetates; Antiviral Agents; Chemoprevention; Cidofovir; Cytomegalovirus; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Drug Resistance, Viral; Ganciclovir; Humans; Immunocompromised Host; Quinazolines; Transplant Recipients; Transplantation Conditioning; Valganciclovir","Taylor and Francis Ltd",Article,Scopus

Expert opinion: Letermovir is a new antiviral to prevent cytomegalovirus infection. Unlike the currently used polymerase inhibitors, it has a distinct mechanism of action with better safety, limited resistance, and no cross-resistance. Although a lot of research on pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions has already been performed, it might be useful to clarify the effect of letermovir on voriconazole exposure, the drug–drug interaction between caspofungine and letermovir and the effect of statins on letermovir exposure. Also, the lack of an exposure–response relationship should be confirmed in large real-life post-marketing studies in order to be able to lower the intravenous dose of letermovir. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ABC transporter subfamily B; aciclovir; atorvastatin; creatinine; cyclosporine; cytochrome P450 2C19; cytochrome P450 2C9; cytochrome P450 3A4; ethinylestradiol plus levonorgestrel; fluconazole; letermovir; midazolam; mycophenolic acid; placebo; posaconazole; proton pump inhibitor; rapamycin; solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1; solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B3; spironolactone; tacrolimus; ursodeoxycholic acid; voriconazole; acetic acid; antivirus agent; letermovir; quinazoline derivative; antiviral activity; antiviral resistance; area under the curve; Article; atrial fibrillation; coughing; creatinine blood level; cytomegalovirus infection; diarrhea; drug absorption; drug bioavailability; drug efficacy; drug excretion; drug half life; drug indication; drug mechanism; drug metabolism; drug safety; headache; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; infection prevention; maximum plasma concentration; medical literature; Medline; nausea; nephrotoxicity; neutropenia; nonhuman; peripheral edema; pharmacogenetics; side effect; tachycardia; thrombocytopenia; time to maximum plasma concentration; treatment outcome; volume of distribution; vomiting; Cytomegalovirus; cytomegalovirus infection; drug interaction; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; procedures; Acetates; Antiviral Agents; Cytomegalovirus; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Drug Interactions; Drug Resistance, Viral; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Quinazolines","Taylor and Francis Ltd",Article,Scopus

Almost all (39/40) started alemtuzumab after discontinuing multiple disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) because of either lack of response or safety concerns. We considered the proportion of alemtuzumab-treated patients who had no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) and disability improvement over a 36-month follow-up period. NEDA-3 was defined as absence of relapses, disability worsening, and MRI activity. Disability improvement was defined as a sustained reduction of ≥ 1-point in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. At follow-up, 18 (45%) patients achieved NEDA-3, 30 (75%) were relapse-free, 33 (82.5%) were EDSS worsening-free, and 25 (62.5%) were MRI activity-free. Eleven (27.5%) patients had a sustained disability improvement. We found no predictor for the NEDA-3 status, while the interaction of higher EDSS score by higher number of pre-alemtuzumab relapses was associated with a greater chance of disability improvement (odds ratio 1.10, p = 0.049). Our study provides real-world evidence that alemtuzumab can promote clinical and MRI disease remission, as well as disability improvement, in a significant proportion of patients with RRMS despite prior multiple DMT failures.

Yet, there have been few criminal prosecutions and regulatory enforcement actions against providers who have violated laws and best practice standards due to the lack of resources and legal ambiguity. While the stem cell research community has invested much in protecting patients and preventing the growth of this industry, some patients are seeking remedies under civil law to hold stem cell clinics responsible for fraudulent practices. Several patients have filed lawsuits against providers demanding compensation for physical injuries caused by unproven treatments and financial losses due to fraud and false advertising. Lawsuits can be used as a tool not only to compensate plaintiffs but also to achieve positive public health and policy outcomes. In this paper, we explore the value of a public health litigation strategy as a countermeasure against the exploitative practices of the unproven SCI industry by analyzing stem cell lawsuits and comparing them with other major public health litigation efforts. We argue that stem cell lawsuits complement other approaches to reining in unsafe practices. In particular, stem cell lawsuits could intensify publicity and raise awareness of the harms of unproven treatments, set legal precedent, reshape the media narrative from one focused on the right to try or practice to one highlighting the need for adequate safety and efficacy standards, and encourage authorities to turn their attention to policy reform and enforcement. © 2018, The Author(s).","Crime; Cytology; Losses; Marketing; Public health; Best practices; Civil laws; Civil lawsuits; Commercial entity; Criminal prosecutions; Developed countries; Physical injuries; Research communities; Stem cell research; Stem-cell; Stem cells; direct-to-consumer advertizing; food and drug administration; health care policy; human; law suit; patient advocacy; priority journal; public health; Review; stem cell research; stem cell transplantation; United States","Nature Publishing Group",Review,Scopus

These products may be approved for marketing under “conditional authorizations,” while uncertainty around safety and efficacy is reduced through the collection of clinical data in observational trials or registries. The rationale for conditional approval programs assumes that patients with unmet medical needs will benefit with rapid access to novel stem cell therapies. It also assumes that data gathered in actual clinical contexts is inherently better at reducing uncertainty than conventional clinical trial methods of demonstrating safety and efficacy. These assumptions may be overly optimistic and do not account for the broader societal burdens of prematurely releasing high-cost therapies with uncertain safety risks and benefits on to health-care markets. This essay focuses on the introduction of conditional approval programs for autologous somatic stem cell therapies and argues that these programs may conflict with, and potentially undermine, the normative commitments of regulatory agencies charged with promoting population health and protecting vulnerable groups from harm and exploitation. It concludes with suggestions of how programs designed to accelerate access to potentially helpful but experimental interventions could be reconfigured to be more equitable. © 2018 by Johns Hopkins University Press.","autotransplantation; economics; ethics; European Union; human; international cooperation; Japan; patient participation; social justice; stem cell transplantation; European Union; Humans; International Agencies; Japan; Patient Participation; Social Justice; Stem Cell Transplantation; Transplantation, Autologous","Johns Hopkins University Press",Article,Scopus

This article refutes the notion that clinician autonomy and consumer demand are a sufficient justification for offering patients unproven autologous SCBIs. We argue that, while clinician and consumer preferences need to be taken seriously, access to unproven SCBIs can only be fully justified when it is based on a commitment to beneficence and prudence.

This development is surprising since the marketing and distribution of human cell-based medical products is stringently regulated in the US. This essay describes ambiguities, gaps, and inconsistencies in the current regulatory system that have enabled such businesses to thrive. In addition to directly challenging the authority of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over autologous cell-based products in the courts, stem cell marketing firms have also identified and exploited regulatory loopholes, such as the same surgical procedure exception, which exempts from FDA oversight human cell-based products that are harvested and reimplanted in a single procedure. Many businesses also advertise stem cell clinical studies on a pay-to-participate basis, which requires patients to pay large sums to enroll in clinical research. This business model not only shifts many of the cost and risks of medical experimentation from providers to patients but may also indemnify sellers from fraud litigation. Lastly, stem cell advertisers borrow heavily from the language and concepts of science-based medicine in their marketing. The inaccurate promotion of autologous stem cell injections as a form of “personalized” medicine lends a veneer of credibility and precision that may encourage patients to undergo procedures of uncertain effectiveness and to sympathize with stem cell businesses in their efforts to evade oversight. © 2018 by Johns Hopkins University Press.","autotransplantation; clinical trial (topic); economics; ethics; food and drug administration; government; human; legislation and jurisprudence; marketing; patient participation; personalized medicine; procedures; stem cell transplantation; United States; Clinical Trials as Topic; Federal Government; Humans; Marketing; Patient Participation; Precision Medicine; Stem Cell Transplantation; Transplantation, Autologous; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration","Johns Hopkins University Press",Article,Scopus

The efficacy of ERT has been evaluated in clinical trials and in many post-marketing studies with a long-term follow-up for MPS I, MPS II, and MPS VI. While ERT is effective in reducing urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and liver and spleen volume, cartilaginous organs such as the trachea and bronchi, bones and eyes are poorly impacted by ERT probably due to limited penetration in the specific tissue. ERT in the present formulations also does not cross the blood-brain barrier, with the consequence that the central nervous system is not cured by ERT. This is particularly important for severe forms of MPS I and MPS II characterized by cognitive decline. For severe MPS I patients (Hurler), early haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the gold standard, while still controversial is the role of stem cell transplantation in MPS II. The use of ERT in patients with severe cognitive decline is the subject of debate; the current position of the scientific community is that ERT must be started in all patients who do not have a more effective treatment. Neonatal screening is widely suggested for treatable MPS, and many pilot studies are ongoing. The rationale is that early, possibly pre-symptomatic treatment can improve prognosis. All patients develop anti-ERT antibodies but only a few have drug-related adverse reactions. It has not yet been definitely clarified if high-titre antibodies may, at least in some cases, reduce the efficacy of ERT. © 2018 The Author(s).","elosulfase alfa; galsulfase; glycosaminoglycan; iduronate 2 sulfatase; laronidase; anaphylaxis; angioneurotic edema; arthropathy; Article; bone growth; bronchoconstriction; central nervous system disease; drug efficacy; drug eruption; drug safety; drug tolerability; ear disease; endurance; enzyme replacement; heart disease; human; Hunter syndrome; Hurler syndrome; immunogenicity; infusion related reaction; liver weight; lung function; Maroteaux Lamy syndrome; Morquio syndrome; mucopolysaccharidosis; nonhuman; nose disease; quality of life; rhinitis; spleen size; throat disease; trachea disease; urticaria; complication; mucopolysaccharidosis; patient selection; treatment outcome; Enzyme Replacement Therapy; Humans; Mucopolysaccharidoses; Patient Selection; Treatment Outcome","BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Although the fruit is widely studied, few works focus other vegetal materials, which could be excellent sources of metabolites with potential application in several industries. Additionally, some M. indica varieties remain unstudied. The aim of this work was to explore for the first time the chemical composition and the biological properties of aqueous extracts from M. indica var. Nunkourouni leaf and stem bark. Malic and quinic acids were the most abundant organic acids. Mangiferin and gallic acid were the main phenolics in stem bark and leaves, respectively. A concentration-dependent activity was noticed against several reactive species, stem bark displaying stronger antioxidant capacity. The two materials also inhibit α-glucosidase and α-amylase, leaves being more potent. The cytotoxic effects on AGS cells were also approached, leaves being the most active material. The results suggest that M. indica leaf and stem bark could be valuable sources of bioactive compounds, contributing to the valorisation of these materials and their further application in high prevalence diseases. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Antioxidants; Cytotoxicity; Anti diabetics; Antioxidant capacity; Biological properties; Chemical compositions; Concentration-dependent; Cytotoxic; Mangifera indica L; Metabolic profiling; Plants (botany); antioxidant; bark; biomass; chemical composition; concentration (composition); crop plant; crop residue; dicotyledon; disease prevalence; enzyme; enzyme activity; metabolism; metabolite; phytochemistry; plant extract; toxicity; Mangifera indica","Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus

Although cure rates for aggressive malignancies have increased, nowhere has progress been more impactful than in the management of typically incurable forms of haematological cancer. Population-based data have shown that 5-year survival for patients with chronic myelogenous and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, indolent B-cell lymphomas, and multiple myeloma has improved markedly. This improvement is a result of substantial changes in disease management strategies in these malignancies. Several haematological malignancies are now chronic diseases that are treated with continuously administered therapies that have unique side-effects over time. In this Commission, an international panel of clinicians, clinical investigators, methodologists, regulators, and patient advocates representing a broad range of academic and clinical cancer expertise examine adverse events in haematological malignancies. The issues pertaining to assessment of adverse events examined here are relevant to a range of malignancies and have been, to date, underexplored in the context of haematology. The aim of this Commission is to improve toxicity assessment in clinical trials in haematological malignancies by critically examining the current process of adverse event assessment, highlighting the need to incorporate patient-reported outcomes, addressing issues unique to stem-cell transplantation and survivorship, appraising challenges in regulatory approval, and evaluating toxicity in real-world patients. We have identified a range of priority issues in these areas and defined potential solutions to challenges associated with adverse event assessment in the current treatment landscape of haematological malignancies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","acalabrutinib; alpha2b interferon; atezolizumab; avelumab; axicabtagene ciloleucel; blinatumomab; bosutinib; brentuximab vedotin; copanlisib; dasatinib; durvalumab; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hyaluronidase; ibritumomab tiuxetan; ibrutinib; imatinib; inotuzumab ozogamicin; interleukin 2; ipilimumab; lenalidomide; lirilumab; nilotinib; nivolumab; obinutuzumab; ofatumumab; pembrolizumab; pomalidomide; rituximab; tisagenlecleucel T; unindexed drug; B cell lymphoma; blood toxicity; cancer survival; cardiotoxicity; chronic lymphatic leukemia; clinical outcome; clinical practice; data base; disease assessment; disorders of higher cerebral function; drug exposure; drug safety; drug surveillance program; drug tolerability; electronic medical record; EuroQOL 5D; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy; gastrointestinal toxicity; health care delivery; hematologic malignancy; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; immunotherapy; immunotoxicity; male sexual dysfunction; marketing; medical documentation; molecularly targeted therapy; monitoring; multiple myeloma; patient-reported outcome; polypharmacy; priority journal; quality of life assessment; Review; survivorship; toxicity; clinical trial (topic); hematologic disease; methodology; safety; Clinical Trials as Topic; Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; Research Design; Safety","Elsevier Ltd",Review,Scopus

Survival from time of relapse is typically measured in weeks to months, and standard chemotherapy and currently approved targeted therapy achieve remission in less than a third of affected patients. To date, the only definitive curative therapy has been allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Advances in immunotherapy, with the introduction of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies and the development of tisagenlecleucel, have changed the landscape. Areas covered: This review will describe the pharmacology of tisagenlecleucel and summarize the clinical evidence for its use in the treatment of multiple-relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Also discussed are other immunotherapies for B-ALL as well as the most commonly-encountered toxicities and corresponding management strategies. Expert commentary: Early phase trials indicate that tisagenlecleucel significantly improves survival for patients with B-ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse. In responding patients, remissions have been reported on the order of years, and thus, tisagenlecleucel may herald a dramatic shift in the treatment paradigm of this largely fatal disease. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","tisagenlecleucel T; lymphocyte antigen receptor; tisagenlecleucel T; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; antineoplastic activity; Article; B cell leukemia; cancer chemotherapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer survival; drug efficacy; drug marketing; drug metabolism; evidence based medicine; human; leukemia relapse; leukemia remission; pharmacodynamics; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); postmarketing surveillance; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; child; immunology; immunotherapy; pathology; procedures; recurrent disease; survival rate; young adult; Child; Humans; Immunotherapy; Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell; Recurrence; Survival Rate; Young Adult","Taylor and Francis Ltd",Article,Scopus

It is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous multi-faceted joint disease with multi-tissue involvement of varying severity. Current therapeutic regimens for OA are only partially effective and often have significant associated toxicities. There are no disease-modifying drugs approved by the regulatory bodies. Areas covered: We reviewed the opportunities within key OA pathogenetic mechanism: cartilage catabolism/anabolism, pathological remodeling of subchondral bone and synovial inflammation to identify targeted disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs, based on compounds currently in Phase II and III stages of clinical development in which x-ray and/or MRI was used as the structural outcome with/without symptomatic outcomes according to regulatory requirements. Expert opinion: Given the heterogeneity of the OA disease process and complex overlapping among these phenotypes, a ‘one size fits all’ approach used in most clinical trials would unlikely be practical and equally effective in all patients, as well as in all anatomical OA sites. On the other hand, it is a challenge to develop a targeted drug with high activity, specificity, potency, and bioavailability in the absence of toxicity for long-term use in this chronic disease of predominantly older adults. Further research and insight into evaluation methods for drug-targeted identification of early OA and specific characterization of phenotypes, improvement of methodological designs, and development/refinement of sensitive imaging and biomarkers will help pave the way to the successful discovery of disease-modifying drugs and the optimal administration strategies in clinical practice. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","antiinflammatory agent; bisphosphonic acid derivative; calcitonin; cathepsin K inhibitor; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; fibroblast growth factor 18; interleukin 1; licofelone; matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein; matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor; osteogenic protein 1; parathyroid hormone; strontium ranelate; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; antirheumatic agent; biological marker; biosynthesis; bone metabolism; bone remodeling; cartilage; clinical outcome; disease course; drug bioavailability; drug marketing; drug mechanism; drug potency; drug specificity; drug targeting; human; long term care; mesenchymal stem cell; morbidity; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteitis; osteoarthritis; osteoclast; pathogenesis; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); phenotype; prevalence; Review; synovitis; thrombocyte rich plasma; Wnt signaling; X ray; adult; drug design; metabolism; osteoarthritis; pathophysiology; severity of illness index; Adult; Antirheumatic Agents; Biomarkers; Drug Design; Humans; Osteoarthritis; Prevalence; Severity of Illness Index","Taylor and Francis Ltd",Review,Scopus

There is hype in research grants, peer-reviewed publications, scientific abstracts, institutional press releases, media representations, and, of course, in the associated marketing of a new product. There is also evidence that it has played a particularly significant role in the area of genetic research. Science hype is a complex phenomenon that involves many actors.

However, limits may exist for which indications SC therapies might be useful, efficacious, and safe. Applications of innovative therapies within regulatory boundaries and within the framework of controlled clinical trials are the norm in the scientific and medical community; such a system minimizes patient risk by setting a clear and acceptable safety and efficacy profile for new therapeutics before marketing authorization. This careful clinical validation approach often takes time, which patients suffering from terminal or debilitating diseases do not have. Not validated, unproven stem cell interventions (SCI) that promise a working treatment or cure for severe diseases have therefore found their way into the patient community, and providers of such treatments often take advantage of the public's willingness to pay large amounts of money for the misguided hope of a reliable recovery from their illnesses. We conducted a review of scientific publications, clinical case reports, and mass media publications to assess the reported cases and safety incidents associated with unproven SCI.

Since it received marketing authorization more than a decade ago, many authors have reported on its off-label use in pediatric patients, despite the fact that the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in children have not been extensively investigated. Areas covered: We reviewed pediatric studies published between 2010 and 2017 describing the prophylactic and therapeutic use of posaconazole, with special attention to the correlation between oral dose, plasma levels, safety, and effectiveness. We found that posaconazole is well tolerated in children with a low incidence of adverse effects. As in adults, posaconazole absorption is hampered by factors such as high gastric pH, mucositis, and concomitant medications, whereas there is no direct correlation between the daily dose and the trough plasma concentration due to saturable absorption. Expert Commentary: Posaconazole has proved safe and effective in preventing and treating fungal infections in immunocompromised children. A body-weight-based dosing regimen and therapeutic drug monitoring are recommended to optimize posaconazole plasma concentration. Absorption can be improved by high-fat foods or avoiding the use of proton-pump inhibitors. Further pediatric studies are needed especially for the new formulations of posaconazole (vials and tablets). © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","alanine aminotransferase; amphotericin B; aspartate aminotransferase; cyclosporine; cytochrome P450 3A4; fluconazole; histamine H2 receptor antagonist; itraconazole; posaconazole; proton pump inhibitor; vincristine; voriconazole; antifungal agent; posaconazole; triazole derivative; abdominal pain; antifungal resistance; child; cholestasis; constipation; convulsion; delayed drug release; diarrhea; dosage schedule comparison; drug absorption; drug bioavailability; drug blood level; drug dose comparison; drug dose escalation; drug efficacy; drug monitoring; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; food; food drug interaction; gastrointestinal disease; gastrointestinal symptom; graft versus host reaction; hematologic malignancy; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; hypertransaminasemia; ileus; immunocompromised patient; inappropriate vasopressin secretion; liver toxicity; minimum inhibitory concentration; minimum plasma concentration; mucosa inflammation; muscle cramp; nausea; neurotoxicity; neutropenia; nonhuman; off label drug use; optimal drug dose; pancreatitis; peripheral neuropathy; pruritus; QT prolongation; Review; salvage therapy; seizure; sinus bradycardia; stomach pH; systemic mycosis; vomiting; age; dose response; immunocompromised patient; microbiology; procedures; systemic mycosis; Age Factors; Antifungal Agents; Child; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Monitoring; Humans; Immunocompromised Host; Invasive Fungal Infections; Off-Label Use; Triazoles","Taylor and Francis Ltd",Review,Scopus

The continued reduction in use of antimicrobials has created incentives for companies to develop functional products that have the potential to replace them. Innovative classes of products show promise ... but as yet are not being widely trialled or applied, nor giving consistent results.

Centers offering these therapies are often marketing and charging patients out-of-pocket costs for such services. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the current marketed: (1) prices and (2) clinical efficacy of stem-cell therapies for knee OA. This was a prospective cross-sectional study which queried 317 U.S. centers that offered direct-to-consumer stem-cell therapies for musculoskeletal conditions. A total of 273 of 317 centers were successfully contacted via phone or e-mail, using a simulated 57-year-old male patient with knee OA. Scripted questions were asked by the simulated patient to determine the marketed prices and clinical efficacy. Centers generally reported the proportion of patients who had good results or symptomatic improvement. The mean price of a unilateral (same-day) stem-cell knee injection was $5,156 with a standard deviation of $2,446 (95% confidence interval [CI]: $4,550-5,762, n = 65). The mean proportion of claimed clinical efficacy was 82% with a standard deviation of 9.6% (95% CI: 79.0-85.5%, n = 36). Most American stem-cell centers offer therapies for knee OA. The cost of these therapies averages about $5,000 per injection, and centers claim that 80% of the patients had good results or symptomatic improvement, denoting a gap between what is documented in the published literature and the marketing claims. These findings offer both patients and physicians insight into the current stem-cell market for knee OA. We hope that with this information, providers can more optimally make patients aware of discrepancies between what is being marketed versus the current evidence-based landscape of these therapies for knee OA.

Process: Indian Academy of Pediatrics conducted a consultative meeting on umbilical cord blood banking on 25th June 2016 in Pune, attended by experts in the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation working across India. Review of scientific literature was also performed. All expert committee members reviewed the final manuscript. Objective: To bring out consensus guidelines for umbilical cord banking in India. Recommendations: Umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation has been used to cure many malignant disorders, hematological conditions, immune deficiency disorders and inherited metabolic disorders, even when it’s partially HLA mismatched. Collection procedure is safe for mother and baby in an otherwise uncomplicated delivery. Public cord blood banking should be promoted over private banking. Private cord blood banking is highly recommended when an existing family member (sibling or biological parent) is suffering from diseases approved to be cured by allogenic stem cell transplantation. Otherwise, private cord blood banking is not a ‘biological insurance’, and should be discouraged. At present, autologous cord stem cells cannot be used for treating diseases of genetic origin, metabolic disorders and hematological cancers. Advertisements for private banking are often misleading. Legislative measures are required to regularize the marketing strategies of cord blood banking. © 2018, Indian Academy of Pediatrics.","advertising; allogeneic stem cell transplantation; Article; blood bank; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; HLA system; human; immune deficiency; India; metabolic disorder; pediatrics; practice guideline; stem cell transplantation; umbilical cord blood; blood bank; consensus development; cord blood stem cell transplantation; fetus blood; health care policy; medical society; organization and management; procedures; standards; Blood Banks; Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation; Fetal Blood; Health Policy; Humans; India; Pediatrics; Societies, Medical","Springer",Article,Scopus

A total of 653 patients were registered during the 2-year enrollment period starting from May 2013, and 627 and 614 patients were eligible for safety and efficacy analyses of the G-CSF biosimilar, respectively. Forty-three adverse drug reactions were reported in 33 patients (5.26%). Back pain was most frequently observed and reported in 20 patients (3.19%), followed by pyrexia (1.28%) and bone pain (0.96%). Risk factors for adverse reactions identified by logistic regression analyses were younger age, presence of past medical history, and lower total dose at the onset of adverse reactions. Among the 576 cancer patients who developed Grade 2–4 neutropenia after chemotherapy, recovery to Grade 1/0 was reported in 553 patients (96%) following filgrastim biosimilar 2 treatment. The median duration of neutrophil counts below 1500/μL was 5 days. In addition, all 11 patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had good responses to filgrastim biosimilar 2.

There are currently thousands of active clinical trials that are ongoing, seeking hope for incurable conditions thanks to the increased accessibility and reliability of gene editing and cellular reprogramming. Accomplishments in various adoptive T cell immunotherapies and chimeric antigen receptor (CART) T cell therapies oriented researchers to the field. Cellular therapies are believed to be the next generation of curative therapeutics in many ways, the classification and nomenclature for these applications have not yet reached a consensus. Trends in recent years are moving towards making tissues and cell processes only in centers with production permits. It is quite promising that competent authorities have increased licensing activities of tissue and cell establishments in their countries, under good practice (GxP) rules, and preclinical and clinical trials involving cell-based therapies have led to significant investments. Despite the initiatives undertaken and the large budgets that have been allocated, only limited success has been achieved in cellular therapy compared to conventional drug development. Cost, and cost effectiveness, are important issues for these novel therapies to meet unmet clinical needs, and there are still many scientific, translational, commercializational, and ethical questions that do not have answers.

The involvement of complementary and alternative medicine practitioners in the marketing of stem cell therapies and stem cell-related interventions is understudied. This research explores the extent to which they are involved and collaborate with medical professionals. This knowledge will help with identifying and evaluating potential policy responses to this growing market. Design Systematic website analysis. Setting Global. US and English-language bias due to methodology. Main outcome measures Representations made on clinic websites in relation to practitioner types, stem cell therapies and their targets, stem cell-related interventions. Statements about stem cell therapies relating to evidence of inefficacy, limited evidence of efficacy, general procedural risks, risks specific to the mode of therapy, regulatory status, experimental or unproven nature of therapy. Use of hype language (eg, language that exaggerates potential benefits). Results 243 websites offered stem cell therapies. Many websites advertised stem cell transplantation from multiple sources, such as adipose-derived (112), bone marrow-derived (100), blood-derived (28), umbilical cord-derived (26) and others. Plant stem cell-based treatments and products (20) were also advertised. Purposes for and targets of treatment included pain, physical injury, a wide range of diseases and illnesses, cosmetic concerns, non-cosmetic ageing, sexual enhancement and others. Medical doctors (130), chiropractors (53) and naturopaths (44) commonly work in the clinics we found to be offering stem cell therapies. Few clinic websites advertising stem cell therapies included important additional information, including statements about evidence of inefficacy (present on only 12.76% of websites), statements about limited evidence of efficacy (18.93%), statements of general risks (24.69%), statements of risks specific to the mode(s) of therapy (5.76%), statements as to the regulatory status of the therapies (30.86%) and statements that the therapy is experimental or unproven (33.33%). Hype language was noted (31.69%). Conclusions Stem cell therapies and related interventions are marketed for a wide breadth of conditions and are being offered by complementary and alternative practitioners, often in conjunction with medical doctors. Consumer protection and truth-in-advertising regulation could play important roles in addressing misleading marketing practices in this area. © 2018 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Drug discovery for disorders of the central nervous system is a long and challenging process, with a high attrition rate from the preclinical stages through to marketing a compound. Developing drugs for geriatric neuropsychiatric conditions presents additional challenges, due to the complexity of the symptoms, comorbid diagnoses, and the variability of the population. Despite there being limited success over the past two decades, a number of new approaches have identified potential targets for preclinical development and ultimately clinical testing. Recent Findings: Recent approaches have tried to address specific mechanisms that relate to the disease progression. These approaches include combining a number of ligands into to multi-target compounds, or targeting specific types of cells such as protein kinases or myeloid cells. In addition, the increased use of induced pluripotent stem cell cultures has enabled new compounds to be tested on disease-specific tissues, increasing the success rate of the lead compounds going through the preclinical stages. Summary: New pharmacological agents designed with advanced screening techniques and the shift towards systems pharmacology is changing the landscape of drug discovery in geriatric psychiatry. There is potential for these new agents to produce targeted effects in the framework of disorders that have long been untreatable. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","071031 b; 4 aminobutyric acid; antiinflammatory agent; antioxidant; ban 2401; basimglurant; cannabinoid receptor; chelating agent; cholinergic receptor; crenezumab; histone deacetylase inhibitor; ketamine; ligand; monoclonal antibody; neuropeptide; nicotine; protein inhibitor; protein kinase; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; rasagiline; serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor; serotonin receptor; unclassified drug; valproic acid; vortioxetine; psychotropic agent; Alzheimer disease; Article; bipolar disorder; bone marrow cell; central nervous system disease; clinical study; comorbidity; depression; disease exacerbation; drug development; drug screening; drug targeting; gerontopsychiatry; human; induced pluripotent stem cell; major depression; mild cognitive impairment; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; preclinical study; treatment resistant depression; aged; drug development; gerontopsychiatry; mental disease; procedures; psychopharmacology; trends; Aged; Drug Development; Drug Discovery; Geriatric Psychiatry; Humans; Mental Disorders; Psychopharmacology; Psychotropic Drugs","Current Medicine Group LLC 1",Article,Scopus

However, despite the availability and efficacy of this class of agents, lifelong treatment is still required in a significant proportion of patients Areas covered: We give an overview of the currently available BCR-ABL-directed TKIs and other conventional therapies for CML. We proceed to review the current market and some of the scientific rationale for new drug development before outlining a number of novel therapies, considered broadly as immunotherapies and targeted agents. Published English-language literature was reviewed regarding currently available TKIs; clinical trials repositories were reviewed to identify novel agents recently investigated or under active study. Expert opinion: We recommend discussion with patients and enrolment on an appropriate clinical trial where feasible.

It can be sub-categorized into primary myelofibrosis, post polycythemia vera myelofibrosis and post essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis. MF is a life-threatening hematologic malignancy characterized by dysregulation of the Janus associated kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling network and a heightened inflammatory state. Areas covered: We cover the pathogenesis, clinical features, new prognostic models, current treatment of MF and discuss agents in development. We also cover market review and health care costs associated with some of these therapies. Expert opinion: There are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating novel therapeutic approaches, including selective JAK inhibitors, histone deacetylase/DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, PI3K-inhibitors, Hedgehog/mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) inhibitors, anti-fibrotic agents, immunomodulators, monoclonal antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Ruxolitinib, a potent oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor remains the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medicinal therapy for the treatment of MF. Unmet needs include alleviation of limiting thrombocytopenia and anemia, halting disease progression to acute leukemia, and extending survival. The development of biomarker driven clinical trials of mechanism based novel therapeutics will usher in a new era of advances in the treatment of this chronic and progressive myeloid malignancy. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2 [1 (4 fluorophenyl)ethylamino] 4 (1 methyl 1h pyrazol 4 yl) 6 (2 pyrazinylamino)pyridine; alisertib; antifibrotic agent; azacitidine; cpi 0610; danazol; decitabine; durvalumab; everolimus; imetelstat; incb 050465; itacitinib; n [1 cyclohexyl 2 [2 [4 (4 fluorobenzoyl) 2 thiazolyl] 1 pyrrolidinyl] 2 oxoethyl] 2 (methylamino)propanamide; nivolumab; panobinostat; peginterferon alpha2a; pembrolizumab; pim 447; pomalidomide; pracinostat; prm 151; ribociclib; ruxolitinib; simtuzumab; sonidegib; sotatercept; thalidomide; umbralisib; unclassified drug; biological marker; Janus kinase inhibitor; pyrazole derivative; ruxolitinib; competitive inhibition; cost; disease course; drug cost; drug marketing; health care cost; hematopoiesis; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; JAK-STAT signaling; myelofibrosis; prognosis; Review; stem cell; disease exacerbation; drug design; metabolism; myeloid metaplasia; pathophysiology; Biomarkers; Disease Progression; Drug Design; Humans; Janus Kinase Inhibitors; Primary Myelofibrosis; Pyrazoles","Taylor and Francis Ltd",Review,Scopus

Here, we focus on those intestinal disorders wherein MSCs have been applied for immunotherapeutic purposes and whose results are available. Recent findings By virtue of their ability to favour both tissue regeneration and immune tolerance, together with a substantial lack of immunogenicity, MSCs have gained huge attention in the last decade. Following abundant positive experimental data, a sizable number of clinical trials using MSCs as a new treatment in chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases were carried out with promising results and several are still ongoing. The main indication was refractory Crohn’s disease wherein both feasibility and safety clearly emerged when treating the luminal phenotype with intravenous infusion/s, albeit no definitive conclusion on efficacy may be drawn. By contrast, the availability of robust demonstration also on the efficacy when treating the fistulizing phenotype through local injection/s of MSCs has led to approval of the marketing of an industrial preparation (darvadstrocel). Summary Successful clinical implementation of this attractive option is hampered by a number of obstacles arising from methodology and regulation issues, which require the institution of interdisciplinary task forces before this cell therapy becomes a bedside reality.

Since the heart is unable to cope with tissue damage and no curative treatment is available, researchers are actively investigating novel therapeutic strategies for cardiac regeneration. Cardiac cell therapy and tissue engineering have attracted considerable attention and clinical trials are ongoing to assess clinical efficacy and accommodate translation to the clinic. In addition, cardiac toxicity as a result of drug therapy is one of the main causes of compound attrition during drug development and post-marketing withdrawal. Moreover, although some cardiotoxicity assays have become standard in drug development, these assays require further improvement as they are prone to false-positive and false-negative outcomes. Stem cell and tissue engineering technologies have been proposed as potential tools for addressing these limitations.

Most studies showed an improvement of motor function compared to the control groups, and the improvement appeared in the relatively early stage after transplantation. However, the mechanism by which stem cells help to recover neurological cells remains unclear. Many of the studies or trials were in phase 1 or phase 2; thus, it is too early to conclude the effectiveness of cell therapy. Therefore, further clinical trials at an advanced stage and experimental research using animal models are needed to elucidate the mechanism and efficacy. Conversely, the pharmaceutical agencies that review new drugs and medical devices have installed various systems and policies to accelerate the development of new drugs. For instance, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) has established a special department for cellular and tissue-based products; furthermore, the PMDA has launched a conditional time-limited marketing authorization system. This system makes it possible to rapidly provide new drugs to patients. In addition, the PMDA has installed an accelerated assessment system to facilitate the development of drugs for diseases without route-based treatment. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.",,"Springer Singapore",Book Chapter,Scopus

Hepatotoxicity is among the most common reasons given for drug attrition or withdrawal; this occurs for a multitude of reasons among which is certainly the lack of adequate models able to recapitulate hepatotoxicity in vitro. The loss of compounds in late-stage testing or after marketing is a major financial burden for the pharmaceutical industry and improved models capable of predicting human toxicity of novel compounds at the early stages of testing are highly sought-after. An ideal novel hepatotoxicity model of should be amenable to high-throughput screening and able to recapitulate the hepatic phenotype over an extended period and also model idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI). There are no currently models able to fulfill these requirements. Pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells (PSC-HLCs) are a developing model which show promise for hepatotoxicity testing. However, the current phenotype of PSC-HLCs is closer to a fetal hepatocyte than an adult hepatocyte. The methodologies for generating mature PSC-HLCs close to an idealized hepatotoxicity model remain to be developed, though incremental improvements to the state-of-the-art are frequently made. Novel PSC-HLC technologies are being developed independently in many research groups; as such there is a need for standardization in benchmarking of these cells and for evaluating the performance and functionality of newly developed HLC models. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Humana Press Inc.",Book Chapter,Scopus

Currently, over eleven drugs targeting angiogenesis have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of various malignancies. Of the registered anti-angiogenic clinical trials until the end of 2017 (ClinicalTrials.gov), over 47% were completed, 10% were terminated, 3% withdrawn, over 0.5% were suspended and only 4 trials have culminated in FDA approval for marketing. On the one hand, the clinical benefits of anti-angiogenic drugs prompted the development of novel anti-angiogenic agents. On the other hand, however, a plethora of recent studies demonstrated the emergence of tumor drug resistance towards currently used anti-angiogenic therapeutics. Series of preclinical and clinical studies have highlighted the enigma of drug resistance with functional bypass pathways, and identified compensatory or alternative angiogenic mechanisms assuring tumor growth in the midst of an anti-angiogenic stress environment. In the present review the classical literature of such redundant angiogenic pathways in concert with the key angiogenic factors and specialized cells involved in anti-angiogenic escape mechanisms is described.

However, many ATMPs are being provided to patients under alternative means, such as “hospital exemption” schemes. Holoclar (ex vivo expanded autologous human corneal epithelial cells containing stem cells), a novel treatment for eye burns, is one of the few ATMPs to have been granted marketing authorization and is the first containing stem cells. This review highlights the differences in standards between an authorized and unauthorized medicinal product, and specifically discusses how the manufacture of Holoclar had to be updated to achieve authorization.

Promising developments in the search for effective pharmacotherapies for autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) are reviewed. Summary. The formation and development of cysts characteristic of ADPKD result in inexorable renal and extrarenal manifestations that give rise to more rapid disease progression and more widespread complications than are seen with other forms of chronic kidney disease. To date, no agent has gained Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for use in patients with ADPKD, complicating efforts to meet the medical needs of this population. Although definitive ultrasonographic diagnostic strategies are available, molecular screening approaches lack sufficient evidence and patient outcomes data to support broad clinical application. Recently completed and ongoing clinical trials point to a number of encouraging platforms for evidence-based ADPKD management. Tolvaptan therapy significantly improved cyst burden and slowed disease progression among patients with early-stage ADPKD in a large-scale trial, while somatostatin therapies may also be useful in halting disease progression and managing comorbid polycystic liver disease. Stem cell research and nanomedicine might represent novel approaches to gaining comprehensive insights on ADPKD and, ultimately, to targeting the disease's origins, thereby making restoration of kidney function possible. Conclusion. A number of pharmacotherapy approaches to ADPKD management show promise but are unlikely to be curative, fueling interest among researchers in finding new applications for nanomedicine and stem cell technologies that can slow ADPKD progression and better control complications of the disease.

Its initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration, as monotherapy for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RR-MM), followed soon by a global authorization of its combination with dexamethasone or with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone for the treatment of RR-MM after 1–3 prior lines. In order to optimize its administration, carfilzomib is currently examined in different doses and regimens in relapsed/refractory as well as in newly diagnosed myeloma. Areas covered: This review will focus on the introduction of carfilzomib as an effective anti-myeloma treatment, describing the evolution of the drug from its pre-clinical development to its established use by phase III clinical trials.

ADA-SCID is fatal early in life if untreated. Unconditioned hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant from matched sibling donor represents a curative treatment but is available for few patients. Enzyme replacement therapy can be life-saving, but its chronic use has many drawbacks. This review summarizes the history of ADA-SCID GT over the last 25 years, starting from first pioneering studies in the early 1990s using gamma-retroviral vectors, based on multiple infusions of genetically corrected autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes. HSC represented the ideal target for gene correction to guarantee production of engineered multi-lineage progeny, but it required a decade to achieve therapeutic benefit with this approach. Introduction of low-intensity conditioning represented a crucial step in achieving stable gene-corrected HSC engraftment and therapeutic levels of ADA-expressing cells. Recent clinical trials demonstrated that gamma-retroviral GT for ADA-SCID has a favorable safety profile and is effective in restoring normal purine metabolism and immune functions in patients >13 years after treatment. No abnormal clonal proliferation or leukemia development have been observed in >40 patients treated experimentally in five different centers worldwide. In 2016, the medicinal product Strimvelis™ received marketing approval in Europe for patients affected by ADA-SCID without a suitable human leukocyte antigen-matched related donor. Positive safety and efficacy results have been obtained in GT clinical trials using lentiviral vectors encoding ADA. The results obtained in last 25 years in ADA-SCID GT development fundamentally contributed to improve patients' prognosis, together with earlier diagnosis thanks to newborn screening. These advances open the way to further clinical development of GT as treatment for broader applications, from inherited diseases to cancer.

Through an analysis of comments submitted to the US FDA in 2016 in response to recent draft guidance documents, I show that a sense of ownership and identity in autologous cells is consistently expressed by stakeholders. In the USA and other countries, regulation of cell and tissue biologics as 'drugs' relies substantially on whether a given product has been modified in ways that alter its biological properties, which has direct implications for property and ownership rights.

The second MPS thematic issue of Experimental Biology and Medicine comprises 15 articles by scientists and engineers from the National Institutes of Health, the IQ Consortium, the Food and Drug Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency, an MPS company, and academia. Topics include the progress, challenges, and future of organs-on-chips, dissemination of TCs into Pharma, children’s health protection, liver zonation, liver chips and their coupling to interconnected systems, gastrointestinal MPS, maturation of immature cardiomyocytes in a heart-on-a-chip, coculture of multiple cell types in a human skin construct, use of synthetic hydrogels to create EOs that form neural tissue models, the blood–brain barrier-on-a-chip, MPS models of coupled female reproductive organs, coupling MPS devices to create a body-on-a-chip, and the use of a microformulator to recapitulate endocrine circadian rhythms. While MPS hardware has been relatively stable since the last MPS thematic issue, there have been significant advances in cell sourcing, with increased reliance on human-induced pluripotent stem cells, and in characterization of the genetic and functional cell state in MPS bioreactors. There is growing appreciation of the need to minimize perfusate-to-cell-volume ratios and respect physiological scaling of coupled TCs. Questions asked by drug developers are followed by an analysis of the potential value, costs, and needs of Pharma. Of highest value and lowest switching costs may be the development of MPS disease models to aid in the discovery of disease mechanisms; novel compounds including probes, leads, and clinical candidates; and mechanism of action of drug candidates. Impact statement: Microphysiological systems (MPS), which include engineered organoids and both individual and coupled organs-on-chips and tissue chips, are a rapidly growing topic of research that addresses the known limitations of conventional cellular monoculture on flat plastic – a well-perfected set of techniques that produces reliable, statistically significant results that may not adequately represent human biology and disease. As reviewed in this article and the others in this thematic issue, MPS research has made notable progress in the past three years in both cell sourcing and characterization. As the field matures, currently identified challenges are being addressed, and new ones are being recognized. Building upon investments by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and Environmental Protection Agency of more than $200 million since 2012 and sizable corporate spending, academic and commercial players in the MPS community are demonstrating their ability to meet the translational challenges required to apply MPS technologies to accelerate drug development and advance toxicology. © 2017, © 2017 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","dimeticone; interleukin 2; biotechnology; electrophysiology; gene expression; human; immunology; induced pluripotent stem cell; lung edema; marketing; medical research; metabolomics; nonhuman; Note; patient safety; phenotype; predictive value; principal component analysis; prophylaxis; risk factor; toxicology; devices; lab on a chip; microchip analysis; microfluidics; physiology; preclinical study; procedures; tissue engineering; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Microchip Analytical Procedures; Microfluidics; Tissue Engineering","SAGE Publications Inc.",Note,Scopus

While the standard recommendation for the management of urine leakage is pelvic floor muscle training, its efficacy is still unsatisfactory. Therefore, we have focused on regenerative therapy, which consists of administering a periurethral injection of autologous regenerative cells from adipose tissue, separated using the Celution® system. Based on an interim data analysis of our exploratory study, we confirmed the efficacy and acceptable safety profile of this treatment. Accordingly, we began discussions with Japanese regulatory authorities regarding the development of this therapy in Japan. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare suggested that we implement a clinical trial of a new medical device based on the Pharmaceutical Affaires Act in Japan. Next, we discussed the design of this investigator-initiated clinical trial (the ADRESU study) aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of this therapy, in a consultation meeting with the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency. Methods: The ADRESU study is an open-label, multi-center, single-arm study involving a total of 45 male stress urinary incontinence patients with mild-to-moderate urine leakage persisting more than 1 year after prostatectomy, in spite of behavioral and pharmacological therapies. The primary endpoint is the rate of patients at 52 weeks with improvement of urine leakage volume defined as a reduction from baseline greater than 50% by 24-h pad test. Our specific hypothesis is that the primary endpoint result will be higher than a pre-specified threshold of 10%. Discussion: The ADRESU study is the first clinical trial of regenerative treatment for stress urinary incontinence by adipose-derived regenerative cells using the Celution® system based on the Japanese Pharmaceutical Affaires Act. We will evaluate the efficacy and safety in this trial to provide an adequate basis for marketing approval with the final objective of making this novel therapy widely available for Japanese patients.

While this framework appears to offer enormous opportunities for the translation of stem cell science, it raises ethical challenges that have not yet been fully explored. This paper critically analyzes this framework with respect to the prioritization of safety over clinical benefit, distributive justice and public trust in science and medicine.

Bleeding is mostly mucocutaneous, but can be severe. Area covered: We review the pathobiology, diagnosis and management of GT. Diagnosis requires the demonstration of absent/defective platelet aggregation to physiologic stimuli but normal to ristocetin (gold standard). Flow cytometry can confirm αIIbβ3 deficiency but not dysfunction. Platelet transfusion is the standard of care for bleeding and trauma/surgery not responsive to conservative treatment, but there are potential complications with clinical consequences such as development of platelet-antibodies. Results from a previous international survey and the GT Registry suggest rFVIIa may be effective with few safety concerns in GT patients with and without platelet antibodies and/or platelet refractoriness. Expert opinion: Whenever possible, rFVIIa should be preferred in patients with past or present platelet-antibodies and/or platelet-refractoriness or when platelet concentrates are not immediately available. rFVIIa is preferred over platelet transfusion in type I GT with severe mutation (or when molecular diagnosis is not available) to prevent anti-αIIbβ3 development. This is particularly important for women of reproductive age and prepubertal girls, given that anti-αIIbβ3 has the potential to cross the placenta during pregnancy, resulting in fetal/neonatal thrombocytopenia and bleeding. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","aminocaproic acid; antifibrinolytic agent; desmopressin; fibrinogen receptor; hemostatic agent; HLA antigen; recombinant blood clotting factor 7a; thrombin; thrombocyte antibody; thrombocyte concentrate; tranexamic acid; arterial thromboembolism; bacterial transmission; bleeding; blood clotting test; case report; case study; clinical feature; conservative treatment; disease classification; drug efficacy; drug marketing; drug safety; early intervention; family history; flow cytometry; gene editing; gene therapy; genetic disorder; Glanzmann disease; health survey; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; hemostasis; HLA system; human; immunization; medical history; molecular pathology; operative blood loss; patient care; phenotype; pilot study; priority journal; Review; screening test; systemic therapy; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombocyte function; thrombocyte transfusion; thromboembolism; venous thromboembolism","Taylor and Francis Ltd",Review,Scopus

Defining clear and strict regulations for manufacturing of cell therapy products in clinical applications is the best way to give assurance to the public sector for safe usage, harmonizing research projects, and placing barriers for unqualified products from entering this market. To achieve this goal, the Iranian Council for Stem cell Science and Technologies sponsored a project in 2013 to develop a national cell therapy guideline for research and clinical trials. To prepare the preliminary guideline, a comprehensive literature and document review was performed by an expert team. The draft was subsequently revised and approved in May 2014 by a large group of experts who were practically involved in basic and clinical fields of regenerative medicine. The final guideline covered all aspects of cell manufacturing, including ethical issues, manufacturing process, quality controls, transportation, harvesting, storage, and release of cell- based products. The optimal infrastructure of the cell manufacturing facility as well as the eligibilities of man-power working in the facility were also described. After adoption in the Council, the guideline was sent to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education for confirmation and final approval. In this report, we introduce the main topics and mention some of the important items of this guideline.

Public health care systems’ budgets are already strained by growing and aging populations, and many private insurer’s budgets are equally stretched. The current systems that most payers employ to manage their cash flow are not structured to absorb a sudden onslaught of very expensive prescriptions for a large portion of their covered population. Despite this, developers of new regenerative medicines tend to focus on the demands of regulators, not payers, in order to be compliant throughout the clinical trials phases, and to develop a product that ultimately will be approvable. It is not advisable to assume that an approved product will automatically become a reimbursed product, as examples from current practice in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the U.S. demonstrate; similarly, in Europe numerous Advanced-therapy Medicinal Products achieved market authorization but failed to secure reimbursement (e.g., Glybera, Provenge, ChondroCelect, MACI). There are however strategies and approaches that developers can employ throughout clinical development, in order to generate clinical and health economic data which will be necessary to demonstrate the value proposition of the new product and help ensure market access for patients; furthermore, performance based managed entry agreements coupled with post-launch evidence generation can help overcome challenges around product uncertainty at launch and reduce market access delays. © 2017 The Authors.","adenosine deaminase; dendritic cell vaccine; sipuleucel T; Article; autologous stem cell transplantation; breast cancer; budget; clinical development plan; dialysis; drug cost; drug labeling; drug marketing; Europe; health care system; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; hospital cost; human; kidney graft; malignant neoplasm; medicolegal aspect; overall survival; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); regenerative medicine; reimbursement; biomedical technology assessment; cost benefit analysis; economics; trends; United States; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Europe; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Technology, High-Cost; United States","Wiley Blackwell",Article,Scopus

Indeed, vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting Alpha 4 Beta 7 integrin, selectively blocks lymphocytes so that they do not reach gastrointestinal tract. Unfortunately, it is not reimbursed anymore in France since the beginning of 2017 in Crohn’s disease. Other integrin blockers are under development. Also, since 2016, a novel class of biologic, ustekinumab, already used in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, has been approved with restriction in Crohn’s disease after TNF blocker failure. It is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting a p40 subunit shared by interleukins 12 and 23, which are involved in immune response. It also seems that selective blockade of interleukin 23 (risankizumab) is efficacious in Crohn’s disease. Also, small molecules are under development with promising results.

One of the major factors preventing effective screening of new compounds is the lack of a predictive in vitro model of hepatotoxicity. Primary human hepatocytes offer a met-abolically relevant model for which the molecular initiating events of hepatotoxicity can be examined; however, these cells vary greatly between donors and dedifferentiate rapidly in culture. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) offer a reproducible, physiologically relevant and genotypically normal model cell; however, current differentiation protocols produce HLCs with a relatively immature phenotype. During the reprogramming of somatic cells, the epigenome undergoes dramatic changes; however, this “resetting” is a gradual process, resulting in an altered differentiation propensity, skewed toward the lineage of origin, particularly in early passage cultures. We, therefore, performed a comparison of human hepatocyte- and dermal fibroblast-derived iPSCs, assessing the impact of epigenetic memory at all stages of HLC differentiation. These results provide the first isogenic assessment of the starting cell type in human iPSC-derived HLCs. Despite a trend toward improvement in hepatic phenotype in albumin secretion and gene expression, few significant differences in hepatic differentiation capacity were found between hepatocyte and fibroblast-derived iPSCs. We conclude that the donor and inter-clonal differences have a greater influence on the hepatocyte phenotypic maturity than the starting cell type. Therefore, it is not necessary to use human hepatocytes for generating iPSC-derived HLCs. © AlphaMed Press & 2017 The Authors.","albumin; cell surface marker; chemokine receptor CXCR4; cytochrome P450 2D6; cytochrome P450 3A; hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta; hepatocyte nuclear factor 4; insulin; transcription factor GATA 4; transcription factor Sox17; Article; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell isolation; cell maturation; cell metabolism; controlled study; CpG island; disease model; donor; drug screening; endoderm; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epigenetic memory; epigenetics; fibroblast; gene expression; gene expression profiling; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; induced pluripotent stem cell; liver cell; methylation; nonhuman; nuclear reprogramming; phenotype; promoter region; pyrosequencing; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Sendai virus; skin cell; toxic hepatitis; cytology; genetic epigenesis; genetics; induced pluripotent stem cell; liver cell; metabolism; physiology; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Epigenesis, Genetic; Fibroblasts; Hepatocytes; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","AlphaMed Press",Article,Scopus

The Comprehensive In vitro Proarrhythmia Assay paradigm is currently attracting considerable attention as a solution to this problem. While much evaluative work in this new paradigm will be conducted in the non-clinical domain, human electrocardiographic assessments will remain an important component of the overall investigational strategy, possibly being conducted in Phase I trials employing exposure-response modelling.

The contributors to this volume propose that race-based medicine is inextricable from debt in two key senses. They first demonstrate how the financial costs related to race-based medicine disproportionately burden minorities, as well as how monetary debt and race are conditioned by broader relations of power. Second, the contributors investigate how race-based medicine is related to the concept of indebtedness and is often positioned as a way to pay back the debt that the medical establishment-and society at large-owes for the past and present neglect and abuses of many communities of color. By approaching the subject of race-based medicine from an interdisciplinary perspective-critical race studies, science and technology studies, public health, sociology, geography, and law-this volume moves the discussion beyond narrow and familiar debates over racial genomics and suggests fruitful new directions for future research. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of Minnesota.

The attempts to increase healthspan are currently focused on slowing the basic biological processes accompanying aging, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, age-related decline of stress resistance, dysregulated cellular energy sensing and growth pathways, impaired proteostasis, deteriorated stem cell function/bioavailability, as well as oxidative and inflammation stress. A number of pharmacological agents targeting basic aging pathways to extend lifespan and healthspan (i.e., antioxidants, calorie restriction mimetics, autophagy inductors, etc.) are presently under investigation. Uncontrolled supplementation with substances having anti-aging properties can, however, be useless or even harmful. In modern pharmacy, anti-aging is likely one of the most promising markets because the target group can potentially include each individual. Present marketing investigation demonstrates that most people are willing to pay for long-term pharmacological therapy to prevent or delay the aging-related decline in physical and mental functions. Optimistic predictions of the feasibility of health- and life-extending interventions, however, should be critically discussed in the light of their ethical, social and economic implications. Only after in-depth examination and following comprehensive debates will the implementation of such approaches in clinical practice be possible.","anti aging drug; unclassified drug; unclassified drug; aging; Article; drug mechanism; human; life extension","Royal Society of Chemistry",Article,Scopus

We investigated whether iCell® cardiomyocytes have utility as an early QT/TdP screen. Thirty clinical drugs with known QT/TdP outcomes were evaluated blind using label-free microelectrode array (parameters measured were beating period (BP), field potential duration (FPD), fast Na+ amplitude and slope) and live cell, fast kinetic fluorescent Ca2 + transient FLIPR® Tetra (parameters measured were peak count, width, amplitude) systems. Many FPD-altering drugs also altered BP. Correction for BP, using a Log-Log (LL) model, was required to appropriately interpret direct drug effects on FPD. In comparison with human QT effects and when drug activity was to be predicted at top test concentration (TTC), LL-corrected FPD and peak count had poor assay sensitivity and specificity values: 13%/64% and 65%/11%, respectively. If effective free therapeutic plasma concentration (EFTPC) was used instead of TTC, the values were 0%/100% and 6%/100%, respectively. When compared to LL-corrected FPD and peak count, predictive values of uncorrected FPD, BP, width and amplitude were not much different. If pro-arrhythmic risk was to be predicted using Ca2 + transient data, the values were 67%/100% and 78%/53% at EFTPC and TTC, respectively. Thus, iCell® cardiomyocytes have limited value as an integrated QT/TdP assay, highlighting the urgent need for improved experimental alternatives that may offer an accurate integrated cardiomyocyte safety model for supporting the development of new drugs without QT/TdP effects. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","alfuzosin; amiodarone; astemizole; cetirizine; cisapride; dasatinib; dofetilide; doripenem; grepafloxacin; ketoconazole; lapatinib; maraviroc; moxifloxacin; paliperidone; palonosetron; procainamide; quinidine; ranolazine; sertindole; sildenafil; sitagliptin; solifenacin; sotalol; sunitinib; terfenadine; terodiline; tolterodine; unindexed drug; vardenafil; verapamil; calcium channel; culture medium; drug; Article; calcium signaling; cardiac muscle cell; cardiotoxicity; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; drug activity; drug marketing; EC50; electric potential; heart arrhythmia; human; human cell; IC50; induced pluripotent stem cell; QT prolongation; sensitivity and specificity; torsade des pointes; action potential; adverse drug reaction; cardiac muscle cell; cell culture; cell culture technique; chemically induced; chemistry; culture medium; drug effects; induced pluripotent stem cell; long QT syndrome; metabolism; microelectrode; pathophysiology; preclinical study; Action Potentials; Calcium Channels; Cardiotoxicity; Cell Culture Techniques; Cells, Cultured; Culture Media; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Long QT Syndrome; Microelectrodes; Myocytes, Cardiac; Pharmaceutical Preparations","Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus

However, many important issues remain to be addressed, ranging from the detailed molecular dissection of the therapeutic capabilities of stem cells in situ, through to the selection of both patients and sources of cells for clinical trials. Particularly pertinent to patient selection is the importance of enrolling sufficient numbers of patients in clinical trials, especially for comparative studies. Unfortunately, conducting comparative studies is often complicated by limitations on cell processing or the relative rarity of target diseases, so it is difficult to enroll sufficient numbers of patients with diverse backgrounds. Indeed, the number of patients enrolled in comparative stem cell studies is generally small, and few randomized trials have been conducted. In Japan, a new regulatory framework involving conditional and time-limited approval of regenerative products and mandatory post-marketing surveillance after early approval may help resolve the problem, because the enrollment qualification data for many patients will be collected. The translation of stem cell therapies to the clinic is still in its infancy, and stringent efforts to identify and establish suitable patient and control cohorts from diverse genetic, ethnic, and demographic backgrounds remain a high priority for the optimization of clinical trial design. © 2016, Springer International Publishing AG.","age; clinical effectiveness; clinical study; ethnic difference; gender; genetic variability; human; nonhuman; patient selection; postmarketing surveillance; priority journal; process optimization; regenerative medicine; Review; species diversity; stem cell research; stem cell transplantation","Springer International Publishing",Review,Scopus

However, despite this substantial progress and the achievements of the last century, humans still suffer considerably from diseases, especially from infectious diseases. Thus, almost one-fourth of all deaths worldwide are caused directly or indirectly by infectious agents. Although vaccination has led to the control of many diseases, including smallpox, diphtheria, and tetanus, emerging diseases are still not completely contained. Furthermore, pathogens such as Bordetella pertussis undergo alterations making adaptation of the respective vaccine necessary. Moreover, insufficient implementation of vaccination campaigns leads to re-emergence of diseases which were believed to be already under control (e.g., poliomyelitis). Therefore, novel vaccination strategies need to be developed in order to meet the current challenges including lack of compliance, safety issues, and logistic constraints.

The absence or deficiency of the LAL enzyme gives rise to pathological accumulation of cholesterol esters in various tissues. A severe LAL-D phenotype manifesting in infancy is associated with adrenal calcification and liver and gastrointestinal involvement with characteristic early mortality. LAL-D presenting in childhood and adulthood is associated with hepatomegaly, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and premature atherosclerosis. There are currently no curative pharmacological treatments for this life-threatening condition. Supportive management with lipid-modifying agents does not ameliorate disease progression. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a curative measure in infantile disease has mixed success and is associated with inherent risks and complications. Sebelipase alfa (Kanuma) is a recombinant human LAL protein and the first enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of LAL-D. Clinical trials have been undertaken in infants with rapidly progressive LAL-D and in children and adults with later-onset LAL-D. Initial data have shown significant survival benefits in the infant group and improvements in biochemical parameters in the latter. Sebelipase alfa has received marketing authorization in the United States and Europe as longterm therapy for all affected individuals. The availability of enzyme replacement therapy for this rare and progressive disorder warrants greater recognition and awareness by physicians. © 2016 Su et al.","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; colestyramine; ezetimibe; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; mevinolin; sebelipase alfa; simvastatin; abdominal distension; abdominal pain; adulthood; agitation; anaphylaxis; anxiety disorder; childhood; chill; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; coughing; diarrhea; disorders of cholesterol metabolism; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug hypersensitivity; drug safety; dyspnea; eczema; edema; enzyme replacement; eyelid edema; fatigue; fever; gastroesophageal reflux; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; histology; human; hyperemia; hypertension; immunogenicity; infusion related reaction; injection site induration; insomnia; irritability; larynx edema; liver transplantation; lysosomal acid lipase deficiency; maculopapular rash; morbidity; muscle hypotonia; nausea; nose obstruction; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxygen saturation; papular rash; pathophysiology; pharmacodynamics; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); prevalence; pruritus; radiography; respiratory distress; Review; rhinitis; side effect; sneezing; survival; tachycardia; tachypnea; thorax pain; urinary tract infection; urticaria; vomiting; wheezing","Dove Medical Press Ltd.",Review,Scopus

As of 2016, there have been 11 haemophilia gene therapy clinical trials of which six are currently open. Each of the ongoing phase 1/2 trials is testing a variation of a liver-directed adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector encoding either factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX). As summarized herein, the clinical results to date have been mixed with some perceived success and a clear recognition of the immune response to AAV as an obstacle to therapeutic success. We also attempt to highlight promising late-stage preclinical activities for AAV-FVIII where, due to inherent challenges with manufacture, delivery and transgene product biosynthesis, more technological development has been necessary to achieve results comparable to what has been observed previously for AAV-FIX. Finally, we describe the development of a stem cell-based lentiviral vector gene therapy product that has the potential to provide lifelong production of FVIII and provide a functional ‘cure’ for haemophilia A. Integral to this program has been the incorporation of a blood cell-specific gene expression element driving the production of a bioengineered FVIII designed for optimal efficiency.

But their specific nature based on biological materials raises particular challenging issues on how regulation should frame biomedical innovation for society's benefit regarding public health. The European Union (EU) supports the development of cellbased regenerative therapies that are medicinal products with a specific regulation providing their wide access to the European market for European patients. However, once these medicinal products have obtained a European marketing authorisation, they are still far away from being fully accessible to European patients in all EU Member States. Whereas there is much written on the EU regulatory system for new biotechnologies, there is no systematic legal study comparing the insurance provisions in two EU countries. Focussing on the situation in the UK and France that are based on two different healthcare systems, this paper is based on a comparative methodological approach. It raises the question of regulatory reimbursement mechanisms that determine access to innovative treatments and their consequences for social protection systems in the general context of public health. After having compared the French and English regulations of cell-based regenerative therapy regarding pricing and reimbursement, this papers analyses how England and France are addressing two main challenges of cellbased regenerative therapy, to take into account their long-term benefit through their potential curative nature and their high upfront cost, towards their adoption within the English and French healthcare systems. It concludes that England and France have different general legal frameworks that are not specific to the reimbursement of cell-based regenerative therapy, although their two current and respective trends would bring more convergence between the two systems while addressing the main challenges for the reimbursement of these therapies. Nevertheless, despite their current differences, neither the English nor the French national healthcare system has yet approved the reimbursement of cell-based regenerative therapies. The paper highlights where both systems could be learning from each others' experiences to favour the adoption of cellbased regenerative therapies through the adaptation of their reimbursement methodologies. It also emphasises the gap between market access and patients' access, and it calls for research and discussions through reflexive agencies such as the Regenerative Medicine Expert Group in the UK. © The Author 2016.

Bioprinting technology could help overcome the limitations of the current tissue engineering methods, including the problem of longer waiting times for treatment (especially with organ transplants). While fighting infectious diseases had been the main focus of medicine in the past, dealing with the consequences of a predominantly ageing population will be the priority in the future and bioprinting is a promising technology to tackle this challenge effectively. Bioprinting will not only cater the needs of ageing population but also in the field of paediatrics, where the bioprinted tissue or organ should possess the capability to grow with the patient. As researchers around the world are working on 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs, companies are burgeoning all over, making and marketing new bioprinters. While the research and commercialization are moving at such a rapid pace, the issues surrounding the technology, in terms of ethics, policies, regulations and social acceptance, are not addressed in commensurate. Identifying the ELSA (Ethical Legal and Social Aspects) concerns of this technology at an early stage is not only part of our social responsibility but also in the interest of the future of the technology itself. This paper reviews and foresees these challenges with pragmatism, thereby creating awareness to the researchers and policy makers and to urge a positive course of action in the foreseeable future. The significance of this work will be to address a broad audience, associated with this technology, from scientists to businessmen, engineers to clinicians, laymen to lawmakers. A ‘complete’ policy approach for this technology is recommended rather than a ‘piecemeal’ approach of the various constituents of this technology. An effective course of action will be to setup a multi-disciplinary international panel to work on the policy framework, which will look in to both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ impacts of 3D bioprinting, the associated ethical challenges, legal measures including patenting and effective controls to prevent the misuse, as well as the social aspects encompassing the cultural and religious differences which accounts for the success of this technology. Setting up national level panels to assess the risk-benefit analysis, taking into consideration the cultural and religious view of its population and other legal and social aspects, might be a good starting point. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","bioprinting; drug approval; ethics; heart graft; human; human embryonic stem cell; in vitro fertilization; legal aspect; mesenchymal stem cell; model; nonhuman; patent; Review; risk benefit analysis; sensitivity and specificity; social aspect; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; xenograft","Elsevier B.V.",Review,Scopus

The aim was to model the optimal timing for making this change. Materials & methods: A development lifecycle cash flow framework was created to examine the implications of process changes to microcarrier cultures at different stages of a cell therapy's lifecycle. Results: The analysis performed under assumptions used in the framework predicted that making this switch earlier in development is optimal from a total expected out-of-pocket cost perspective. From a risk-adjusted net present value view, switching at Phase I is economically competitive but a post-approval switch can offer the highest risk-adjusted net present value as the cost of switching is offset by initial market penetration with planar technologies.

Furthermore, most products were manufactured from autologous starting material mostly manufactured from stem cells. The majority of the trials were sponsored by academia, whereas phase 3 trials mostly by large companies.

Given their involvement in regulating multiple aspects of gene expression and cell signaling that dictates the behaviors of malignant cells, it is not surprising that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play pivotal roles in the resistance of cancers to clinically available therapeutics. Aberrant expression of these ncRNAs, attributed to inherent defects or stress-responsive variations, mediates cellular signaling that compensates for unfavorable molecular events elicited by the therapeutics, thereby preventing the pharmaceuticals from exerting their desired effects on their cellular targets; alternatively, ncRNAs may regulate cancer therapeutic sensitivity by affecting drug accessibility to neoplastic cells and in vivo drug metabolism. In addition, dysregulation of ncRNA expression in cancer stromal cells can impair the responsiveness of neoplastic cells to appropriate therapies. In this chapter, we will describe ncRNA-related mechanisms underlying cancer resistance to routine therapeutics, hopefully providing rationales for the development of drug-sensitizing strategies targeted against or based on these ncRNAs. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.","ABC transporter; breast cancer resistance protein; epidermal growth factor; epidermal growth factor receptor; multidrug resistance protein 1; nucleoside transporter; steroid hormone; steroid receptor; transcription factor; untranslated RNA; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; apoptosis; autophagy; cancer chemotherapy; cancer gene therapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer resistance; cancer stem cell; cell cycle progression; cell division; cell survival; cell therapy; chemosensitivity; drug marketing; drug targeting; epithelial mesenchymal transition; genotoxicity; human; intracellular signaling; molecularly targeted therapy; nonhuman; ontogeny; oxidative stress; pharmacokinetics; priority journal; tumor microenvironment; drug effects; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; genetics; Neoplasms; signal transduction; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; RNA, Long Noncoding; Signal Transduction","Springer New York LLC",Book Chapter,Scopus

Private cord blood banks deploy clinical discourse to market their services to prospective parents, encouraging them to pay to bank cord blood as a form of 'biological insurance' to ensure their child's future health. Social scientists have examined new forms of (bio)value produced in biological materials emergent with contemporary biotechnologies. This paper contributes to this literature by examining the social and technical production of value in cord blood units collected for private banking. Value, in this paper is defined as a socio-cultural concept in which an object is made meaningful, or valuable, through its relations with social actors and within specific regimes of value. I draw on in-depth interviews with women who banked cord blood and key informants in private banks in Canada, to analyze how social actors produced cord blood as a valuable biological object. I show that a cord blood unit holds promissory value for women who bank and profit value for private banks and that these values are folded into each other and the biological material itself. Analyzing how specific cord blood units are made valuable provides insight into the multiple and possibly competing values of biological materials and the tensions that may arise between social actors and forms of knowledge during the valuing process.","hospital waste; Canada; cord blood stem cell transplantation; cost benefit analysis; economics; ethics; female; financial management; health care facility; hospital waste; human; organization and management; Biological Specimen Banks; Canada; Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Humans; Marketing of Health Services; Medical Waste; Private Sector",,Article,Scopus

In the following years, advocates were also actively engaged in Washington DC, encouraging policy makers to broaden embryonic stem cell research funding, which was ultimately passed after President Barack Obama came into office. Many advocates did this because they were told stem cell research would lead to cures. After waiting more than 10 years, many of these same patients are now approaching clinics around the world offering experimental stem cell-based interventions instead of waiting for scientists in the US to complete clinical trials. How did the same groups who were once (and often still are) the strongest supporters of stem cell research become stem cell tourists? And how can scientists, clinicians, and regulators work to bring stem cell patients back home to the US and into the clinical trial process? Discussion: In this paper, we argue that the continued marketing and use of experimental stem cell-based interventions is problematic and unsustainable. Central problems include the lack of patient protection, US liability standards, regulation of clinical sites, and clinician licensing. These interventions have insufficient evidence of safety and efficacy; patients may be wasting money and time, and they may be forgoing other opportunities for an intervention that has not been shown to be safe and effective. Current practices do not contribute to scientific progress because the data from the procedures are unsuitable for follow-up research to measure outcomes. In addition, there is no assurance for patients that they are receiving the interventions promised or of what dosage they are receiving. Furthermore, there is inconsistent or non-existent follow-up care. Public policy should be developed to correct the current situation. Conclusion: The current landscape of stem cell tourism should prompt a re-evaluation of current approaches to study cell-based interventions with respect to the design, initiation, and conduct of US clinical trials. Stakeholders, including scientists, clinicians, regulators and patient advocates, need to work together to find a compromise to keep patients in the US and within the clinical trial process. Using HIV/AIDS and breast cancer advocate cases as examples, we identify key priorities and goals for this policy effort. © 2015 Matthews and Iltis.","biological therapy; Breast Neoplasms; ethics; food and drug administration; genetic predisposition; genetics; government regulation; health care policy; HIV Infections; human; medical tourism; regenerative medicine; statistics and numerical data; stem cell transplantation; trends; United States; Breast Neoplasms; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Government Regulation; Health Policy; HIV Infections; Humans; Medical Tourism; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Transplantation; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration","BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus

Replacement of a pathologically altered cornea with healthy corneal tissue from the eye of a suitable donor is among the most common and successful transplantation procedures in medicine. In Germany, approximately 5000–6000 corneal transplantations are performed each year, but the total demand per year is estimated to be twice as high. With a success rate of 90 %, the outcome of cornea transplantation is very favourable. However, long-term maintenance and regeneration of a healthy new cornea requires tissue-specific corneal stem cells residing at the basal layer of the limbus, which is the annular transition zone between the cornea and sclera. When this important limbal stem cell population is destroyed or dysfunctional, a pathological condition known as limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) manifests. Limbal stem cell deficiency describes conditions associated with impaired corneal wound healing and regeneration. In this situation, transplantation of healthy limbal stem cells is the only curative treatment approach for restoration of an intact and functional ocular surface. To date, treatment of LSCD presents a great challenge for ophthalmologists. However, innovative, cell-therapeutic approaches may open new, promising treatment perspectives. In February 2015, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to the first stem cell-based treatment in the European Union. The product named Holoclar® is an advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) for the treatment of moderate to severe LSCD due to physical and chemical burns in adults.

This association based on gene expression profile has been used to determine whether the induction/repression of genes correspond to phenotypic variations including cell regulations, clinical diagnoses and drug development. Statistical analyses on microarray data have been developed to resolve gene selection issue. However, these methods do not inform us of causality between genes and phenotypes. In this paper, we propose the dynamic association rule algorithm (DAR algorithm) which helps ones to efficiently select a subset of significant genes for subsequent analysis. The DAR algorithm is based on association rules from market basket analysis in marketing. We first propose a statistical way, based on constructing a one-sided confidence interval and hypothesis testing, to determine if an association rule is meaningful. Based on the proposed statistical method, we then developed the DAR algorithm for gene expression data analysis. The method was applied to analyze four microarray datasets and one Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) dataset: the Mice Apo A1 dataset, the whole genome expression dataset of mouse embryonic stem cells, expression profiling of the bone marrow of Leukemia patients, Microarray Quality Control (MAQC) data set and the RNA-seq dataset of a mouse genomic imprinting study. A comparison of the proposed method with the t-test on the expression profiling of the bone marrow of Leukemia patients was conducted. Results: We developed a statistical way, based on the concept of confidence interval, to determine the minimum support and minimum confidence for mining association relationships among items. With the minimum support and minimum confidence, one can find significant rules in one single step. The DAR algorithm was then developed for gene expression data analysis. Four gene expression datasets showed that the proposed DAR algorithm not only was able to identify a set of differentially expressed genes that largely agreed with that of other methods, but also provided an efficient and accurate way to find influential genes of a disease. Conclusions: In the paper, the well-established association rule mining technique from marketing has been successfully modified to determine the minimum support and minimum confidence based on the concept of confidence interval and hypothesis testing. It can be applied to gene expression data to mine significant association rules between gene regulation and phenotype. The proposed DAR algorithm provides an efficient way to find influential genes that underlie the phenotypic variance. © 2015 Chen et al.","apolipoprotein A1; catalase; dysbindin; polycomb repressive complex 2; accuracy; algorithm; ApoA1 gene; Article; calculation; cell differentiation; data analysis; data mining; down regulation; dynamic association rule algorithm; embryonic stem cell; expressed sequence tag; gene; gene expression; gene identification; gene regulatory network; leukemia; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; Oct4 gene; reproducibility; upregulation; algorithm; animal; biology; cluster analysis; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetic database; genetics; high throughput sequencing; metabolism; mouse; mouse embryonic stem cell; statistics and numerical data; Algorithms; Animals; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Mice; Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells","BioMed Central",Article,Scopus

Cell procurement is nowadays done almost exclusively through cytapheresis, after mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from the marrow to peripheral blood (PB). The egress of HSPCs out of hematopoietic niches occurs in various physiologic or nonhomeostatic situations; pharmacologic approaches include the administration of acutely myelosuppressive agents or hematopoietic growth factors such as recombinant human granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (rHuG-CSF). The introduction of plerixafor, a first-of-its-class molecule that reversibly inhibits the interaction between the chemokine CXCL-12 (also known as SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR-4, has offered new opportunities for the so-called ""poor mobilizers"" who achieve insufficient mobilization and/or collection with conventional approaches. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Because of the lack of consensus on a definition for poor mobilizers and the relatively high cost of plerixafor, French competent authorities have mandated a postmarketing survey on its use in routine practice. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION We report here the results of this nationwide survey that confirms the clinical efficacy of plerixafor, even in the subset of patients who barely increased PB CD34+ cell count in response to rHuG-CSF-containing mobilization regimen. Furthermore, analysis of this registry showed that despite heterogeneity in medical practices, the early - ""on-demand"" or ""preemptive"" - introduction of plerixafor was widely used and did not result in an excess of prescriptions, beyond its expected use at the time when marketing authorization was granted. © 2015 AABB.","CD34 antigen; chemokine receptor CXCR4; plerixafor; recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor; chemokine receptor CXCR4; CXCL12 protein, human; CXCR4 protein, human; heterocyclic compound; plerixafor; stromal cell derived factor 1; abdominal pain; adolescent; adult; Article; autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; child; controlled study; diarrhea; drug cost; drug hypersensitivity; drug megadose; drug surveillance program; drug use; female; health care survey; Hodgkin disease; human; insomnia; lymphocyte count; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; multiple myeloma; nausea; nonhodgkin lymphoma; prescription; aged; antagonists and inhibitors; autograft; blood; clinical trial; economics; France; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; middle aged; multicenter study; procedures; stem cell mobilization; Adult; Aged; Autografts; Chemokine CXCL12; Female; France; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Heterocyclic Compounds; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Receptors, CXCR4","Blackwell Publishing Inc.",Article,Scopus

This includes the importance of the application of cell-based therapy, especially stem cells, for various diseases. Hence, regulations on the use of cells and the pros and cons of its application in the clinical level should also be given equal attention. Recently, regulations in Japan have been reviewed and revised to create more effective and competitive marketing strategy. The Regenerative Medicine Promotion Law was established to provide prompt and safe regenerative medicine products. The Acts on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine entails that medical technologies can be categorized into 3 classes of regenerative medicines based on their risks potentials. It also determines the proper regulation or requirement for each class. Amendment of Pharmaceutical Affairs Act, on the other hand, is regulation in which products can be approved with temporary conditions to enable prompt provision of the products to patients after the safety and efficacy is confirmed. Due to these mitigations in Japan in the advancement of regenerative medicines, we can predict that Japan can be one of the top nations in the production and marketing stem cell therapeutic products by attracting Japanese as well as global companies. Hence, monitoring the changes in the legal policies of regenerative medicine in Japan could be advantageous in the advancement of the current provisions in South Korea geared towards the better achievements in providing the human population with safe, prompt, and effective regenerative medicine therapeutic strategies and products. © 2015, The Korean Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Society and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biomedical engineering; Commerce; Cytology; Disease control; Laws and legislation; Marketing; Stem cells; Cell based therapies; Marketing strategy; Medical technologies; Medicine products; Pharmaceutical affairs laws; Regulatory systems; Therapeutic products; Therapeutic strategy; Regenerative Medicine; cell therapy; human; Japan; Letter; medical technology; monitoring; patient safety; priority journal; regenerative medicine; South Korea; stem cell","Kluwer Academic Publishers",Article,Scopus

Cosmetic and anti-aging products and treatments that make claims regarding stem cell technology are increasingly popular, despite a lack of evidence for safety and efficacy of such products. Objectives This study explores how stem cell-based products and services are portrayed to the public through online sources, in order to gain insight into the key messages available to consumers. Methods A content analysis of 100 web pages was conducted to examine the portrayals of stem cell-based cosmetic and anti-aging products and treatments. A qualitative discourse analysis of one web page further examined how language contributes to the portrayals of these products and treatments to public audiences. Results The majority of web pages portrayed stem cell-based products as ready for public use. Very few web pages substantiated claims with scientific evidence, and even fewer mentioned any risks or limitations associated with stem cell science. The discourse analysis revealed that the framing and use of metaphor obscures the certainty of the efficacy of and length of time for stem cell-based anti-aging technology to be publicly available. Conclusions This study highlights the need to educate patients and the public on the current limits of stem cell applications in this context. In addition, generating scientific evidence for stem cell-based anti-aging and aesthetic applications is needed for optimizing benefits and minimizing adverse effects for the public. Having more evidence on efficacy and risks will help to protect patients who are eagerly seeking out these treatments. © 2015 The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, Inc.","adipocyte; adult stem cell; advertizing; aging; Article; clinical trial (topic); content analysis; cosmetic industry; discourse analysis; embryonic stem cell; esthetic surgery; health care policy; human; nonhuman; online system; patient education; patient safety; priority journal; qualitative analysis; risk; risk assessment; skin care; stem cell research; stem cell transplantation; wrinkle; adverse effects; advertising; age; consumer health information; cutaneous parameters; esthetic surgery; evidence based medicine; financial management; Internet; language; public opinion; rejuvenation; risk factor; stem cell; cell extract; Advertising as Topic; Age Factors; Cell Extracts; Consumer Health Information; Cosmetic Techniques; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Internet; Language; Marketing of Health Services; Public Opinion; Rejuvenation; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Skin Aging; Stem Cells","Oxford University Press",Article,Scopus

This is due, in part, to the existence of so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs), a particularly aggressive type of malignant cell that is capable of indefinite self-replication, is refractory to conventional treatments, and is skilled at spreading and colonizing distant organs. To date, no drugs from big-league Pharma companies are capable of killing CSCs. Why? Quite simply, a classic drug development approach based on mutated genes and pathological protein products cannot efficiently target the plastic, epigenetic proclivity of cancer tissues to generate CSCs. Recent studies have proposed that certain elite metabolites (oncometabolites) and other common metabolites can significantly influence the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic signatures of stemness and cancer. Consequently, cellular metabolism and the core epigenetic codes, DNA methylation and histone modification, can be better viewed as an integrated metaboloepigenetic dimension of CSCs, which we have recently termed cancer metabostemness. By targeting weaknesses in the bridge connecting metabolism and epigenetics, a new generation of metabostemnessspecific drugs can be generated for potent and long-lasting elimination of life-threatening CSCs. Here I evaluate the market potential of re-modeling the oncology drug pipeline by discovering and developing new metabolic approaches able to target the apparently undruggable epigenetic programs that dynamically regulate the plasticity of non-CSC and CSC cellular states. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.","antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic agent; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer metabostemness; cancer research; cancer stem cell; cancer therapy; cell killing; cell metabolism; cell plasticity; cellular parameters; DNA methylation; drug development; drug industry; drug manufacture; drug marketing; drug research; energy metabolism; epigenetics; gene expression; genetic regulation; human; human cell; metaboloepigenetic; molecularly targeted therapy; multicenter study (topic); neoplasm; oncological parameters; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; protein modification; animal; cancer stem cell; cell self-renewal; drug effects; economics; genetic epigenesis; genetics; metabolism; Neoplasms; pathology; procedures; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Self Renewal; Drug Discovery; Drug Industry; Energy Metabolism; Epigenesis, Genetic; Humans; Neoplasms; Neoplastic Stem Cells","Bentham Science Publishers B.V.",Article,Scopus

Medicines are approved for marketing based upon a determination that their benefits outweigh foreseeable risks in specific indications, specific populations, and at specific dosages and regimens. No medicine is 100% safe. A medicine is less safe if the actual risks are greater than the predicted risks. The purpose of preclinical safety assessment is to understand the potential risks to aid clinical decision-making. Ideally preclinical studies should identify potential adverse effects and design clinical studies that will minimize their occurrence. Most regulatory documents delineate the utilization of conventional ""normal"" animal species to evaluate the safety risk of new medicines (i.e., new chemical entities and new biological entities). Animal models of human disease are commonly utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease and to evaluate efficacy but less frequently utilized in preclinical safety assessment. An understanding of the limitations of the animal disease models together with a better understanding of the disease and how toxicity may be impacted by the disease condition should allow for a better prediction of risk in the intended patient population. Importantly, regulatory authorities are becoming more willing to accept and even recommend data from experimental animal disease models that combine efficacy and safety to support clinical development. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","adverse drug reaction; animal; animal testing alternative; clinical trial (topic); disease model; Europe; government regulation; human; legislation and jurisprudence; practice guideline; preclinical study; procedures; species difference; toxicity testing; translational research; United States; Animal Use Alternatives; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Europe; Government Regulation; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Species Specificity; Toxicity Tests; Translational Medical Research; United States","Elsevier B.V.",Review,Scopus

Conventional treatments allow to cure about 60 - 65% of patients with primary tumors and only 20 - 25% of patients with recurrent disease. New treatment approaches and drugs are therefore highly warranted to improve prognosis.Areas covered: This review focuses on the therapeutic approaches that are under development or clinical evaluation in OS. Information was obtained from different and continuously updated data bases, as well as from literature searches, in which particular relevance was given to reports and reviews on new targeted therapies under clinical investigation in high-grade OS.Expert opinion: OS is a heterogeneous tumor, with a great variability in treatment response between patients. It is therefore unlikely that a single therapeutic tool will be uniformly successful for all OS patients. This claims for the validation of new treatment approaches together with biologic/(pharmaco)genetic markers, which may select the most appropriate subgroup of patients for each treatment approach. Since some promising novel agents and treatment strategies are currently tested in Phase I/II/III clinical trials, we may hope that new therapies with superior efficacy and safety profiles will be identified in the next few years. © 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.","alisertib; antineoplastic agent; bevacizumab; bleomycin; cisplatin; cixutumumab; curcumin; cyclophosphamide; dactinomycin; doxorubicin; doxorubicin derivative; eribulin; everolimus; fluorouracil; ifosfamide; irinotecan; irinotecan sucrosofate; methotrexate; mifamurtide; multidrug resistance protein 1; paclitaxel; pazopanib; polo like kinase 1; programmed death 1 ligand 1; rapamycin; recombinant endostatin; sonidegib; sorafenib; thiotepa; unindexed drug; antineoplastic agent; apoptosis; Article; cancer immunotherapy; cancer prognosis; clinical evaluation; drug efficacy; drug marketing; drug safety; human; lung metastasis; molecularly targeted therapy; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; osteosarcoma; stem cell transplantation; animal; Bone Neoplasms; drug design; multimodality cancer therapy; osteosarcoma; pathology; patient selection; prognosis; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Bone Neoplasms; Combined Modality Therapy; Drug Design; Humans; Osteosarcoma; Patient Selection; Prognosis","Taylor and Francis Ltd",Article,Scopus

Some patients with medically unexplained symptoms or alternative medical diagnoses suspect that they chronically suffer from the tick-borne infection Lyme disease. These patients are commonly targeted by providers of alternative therapies. This study was designed to identify and characterize the range of unorthodox alternative therapies advertised to patients with a diagnosis of Lyme disease. Methods. Internet searches using the Google search engine were performed to identify the websites of clinics and services that marketed nonantimicrobial therapies for Lyme disease. We subsequently used the PubMed search engine to identify any scientific studies evaluating such treatments for Lyme disease. Websites were included in our review so long as they advertised a commercial, nonantimicrobial product or service that specifically mentioned utility for Lyme disease. Websites with patient testimonials (such as discussion groups) were excluded unless the testimonial appeared as marketing on a commercial site. Results. More than 30 alternative treatments were identified, which fell into several broad categories: these included oxygen and reactive oxygen therapy; energy and radiation-based therapies; nutritional therapy; chelation and heavy metal therapy; and biological and pharmacological therapies ranging from certain medications without recognized therapeutic effects on Borrelia burgdorgeri to stem cell transplantation. Review of the medical literature did not substantiate efficacy or, in most cases, any rationale for the advertised treatments. Conclusions. Providers of alternative therapies commonly target patients who believe they have Lyme disease. The efficacy of these unconventional treatments for Lyme disease is not supported by scientific evidence, and in many cases they are potentially harmful. © The Author 2015.","bee venom; colestyramine; cortisone; enema; heavy metal; hydrocortisone; immunoglobulin; naltrexone; olmesartan; oxygen; pregnenolone; reactive oxygen metabolite; sodium chlorite; thyroid hormone derivative; alternative medicine; apheresis; Article; Borrelia; Borrelia burgdorgeri; chelation therapy; clinical evaluation; controlled study; energy; human; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; Internet; Lyme disease; Medline; nutritional support; priority journal; stem cell transplantation; therapy effect; alternative medicine; Borrelia burgdorferi; Internet; Lyme disease; procedures; search engine; statistics and numerical data; Borrelia burgdorferi; Complementary Therapies; Humans; Internet; Lyme Disease; Search Engine","Oxford University Press",Article,Scopus

These acts have significantly changed the conditions for clinical application of regenerative medicine. The RM Act covers clinical research and medical practice using processed cells. It specifies the procedures required for clearance to administer said processed cells to humans. The RM Act also introduces a licensing scheme for cell processing centers outside medical institutions. The PMD Act, on the other hand, introduces a specific regulatory framework for regenerative medicine products. Under the PMD Act, conditional and time-limited marketing approval will be given to a regenerative medicine product after exploratory clinical trials have demonstrated probable benefit and proven safety.

In recent years a number of noncardiac drugs have been withdrawn from markets because of cardiotoxicity concerns, while some other drugs have either been withdrawn prior to marketing or required labeling changes that significantly restrict their use. The prediction of arrhythmic risk based on preclinical trials during drug development remains limited despite intensive and costly investigation. Moreover, drug testing using stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes requires a sophisticated platform of sensitive and cell compatible bioanalytical tools with sufficient and accurate recording capacity for key physiological and biochemical changes in the cells. The label-free impedance technology has emerged as a leading platform for detecting spontaneous beating activities of cardiomyocyte. Impedance based assays provide an exceptionally diverse pattern of functional end points, each with the robustness characteristics required to support drug development process and screening.

Plerixafor, a CXCR4 antagonist, can disrupt adhesive leukemia-stroma interactions with potential to increase chemotherapy inhibition.Areas covered: This review of the potential role of plerixafor in leukemia covers the function of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in normal hematopoiesis as well as studies documenting the importance of this system in leukemogenesis. The chemistry and pharmacology of plerixafor, a bicyclam CXCR4 antagonist, are discussed as well as its approved indications in stem-cell mobilization for autologous stem-cell transplantation purposes. The in vitro and murine xenograft effects of CXCR4 antagonism in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) are covered as are clinical trials that have focused on plerixafor in various types of leukemia. Other inhibitors of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis are also discussed as some of these are in current trials in AML.Expert opinion: Whether inhibitors of CXCR4 will have ability to improve outcomes in leukemia remains to be seen.

How does the hegemony then deal with the challenge from the consumer market and what does this tell us about its modus operandi? In developing a theoretical framework to answer these questions, the paper begins with an analysis of the nature of the hegemony of biomedical innovation in general, its close relationship with the research funding market, the current political modes of consumer incorporation, and the ideological role performed by bioethics as legitimating agency. Secondly, taking the case of stem cell innovation, it explores the hegemonic challenge posed by consumer demand working through the global practice based market of medical innovation, the response of the national and international institutions of science and their reassertion of the values of the orthodox model, and the supporting contribution of bioethics. Finally, the paper addresses the tensions within the hegemonic model of stem cell innovation between the key roles and values of scientist and clinician, the exacerbation of these tensions by the increasingly visible demands of health consumers, and the emergence of political compromise. © 2015 The Authors.","ethics; governance approach; hegemony; innovation; market; medicine; political economy; Article; bioethics; biomedical innovation; consumer; economic aspect; funding; health care need; hegemony; human; medical research; political system; social marketing; stem cell transplantation; consumer; consumer attitude; cooperation; forecasting; health care cost; health care delivery; interdisciplinary communication; international cooperation; leadership; mass communication; medical technology; politics; stem cell transplantation; trends; Biomedical Technology; Consumer Behavior; Consumer Participation; Cooperative Behavior; Diffusion of Innovation; Forecasting; Health Care Sector; Health Services Accessibility; Interdisciplinary Communication; Internationality; Leadership; Politics; Stem Cell Transplantation","Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus

It is the leading cause of years lost to disability and poses the highest economic toll among chronic illnesses. Despite the strong need for extensive research efforts, few drugs have consistently demonstrated effectiveness for this condition.Areas covered: In this review, the epidemiology, rationale for mechanism-based treatment, competitive environment and market trends, and the preclinical and clinical evidence supporting over 15 different classes of analgesic medications studied for CLBP or related pain conditions are discussed. Treatments are divided by drug category, type of CLBP they are likely to treat (e.g., neuropathic or mechanical), and whether they are new formulations of existing treatments, new indications for existing treatments or represent novel mechanisms of action. Databases searched included MEDLINE, Embase, Pharmaprojects and various clinical trial registries.Expert opinion: Many barriers exist for the development of medications for CLBP including difficulties in identifying pathophysiological mechanisms, biologic resiliency secondary to multiple concurrent pain pathways and off-target and sometimes serious side effects. Nevertheless, the volume and diversity of novel molecular entities has continued to surge and includes possible disease-modifying therapies such as gene and stem cell therapy. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.","alpha adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; analgesic agent; dopamine uptake inhibitor; glutamate receptor; glycine; n methyl dextro aspartic acid; nitrous oxide; noradrenalin uptake inhibitor; opiate agonist; serotonin uptake inhibitor; toll like receptor agonist; vanilloid receptor 1; voltage gated calcium channel; voltage gated potassium channel; voltage gated sodium channel; analgesic agent; analgesia; drug formulation; drug indication; drug marketing; drug mechanism; gene therapy; glia cell; health care need; human; low back pain; meta analysis (topic); multicenter study (topic); nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); phase 4 clinical trial (topic); randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; stem cell transplantation; systematic review (topic); animal; chronic pain; drug design; low back pain; pathophysiology; Analgesics; Animals; Chronic Pain; Drug Design; Humans; Low Back Pain","Informa Healthcare",Review,Scopus

Advances in the understanding of rotator cuff biology and biomechanics as well as improvements in surgical techniques have led to the development of new strategies that may allow a tendon-to-bone interface healing process, rather than the formation of a fibrovascular scar tissue. Although single-row repair remains the most cost-effective technique to address a rotator cuff tear, some biological intervention has been recently introduced to improve tissue healing and clinical outcome of rotator cuff repair. Animal models are critical to ensure safety and efficacy of new treatment strategies; however, although rat shoulders as well as sheep and goats are considered the most appropriate models for studying rotator cuff pathology, no one of them can fully reproduce the human condition. Emerging therapies involve growth factors, stem cells and tissue engineering. Experimental application of growth factors and platelet-rich plasma demonstrated promising results, but has not yet been transferred into standardized clinical practice. Although preclinical animal studies showed promising results on the efficacy of enhanced biological approaches, application of these techniques in human rotator cuff repairs is still very limited. Randomized controlled clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance are needed to clearly prove the clinical efficacy and define proper indications for the use of combined biological approaches. The following review article outlines the state of the art of rotator cuff repair and the use of growth factors, scaffolds and stem cells therapy, providing future directions to improve tendon healing after rotator cuff repair.Level of evidence Expert opinion, Level V. © 2015, European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).","drug therapy; signal peptide; animal; biological therapy; biomechanics; disease model; drug therapy; human; injuries; pathophysiology; rotator cuff; shoulder; surgery; tendon; Tendon Injuries; therapy; tissue scaffold; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Disease Models, Animal; drug therapy; Humans; injuries; injuries; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; physiopathology; physiopathology; physiopathology; physiopathology; Rotator Cuff; Shoulder Joint; surgery; surgery; surgery; Tendon Injuries; Tendons; therapeutic use; therapy; Tissue Scaffolds","Springer Verlag",Review,Scopus

So-called ""cultured"" or ""synthetic"" or ""in vitro"" meat could in theory be constructed with different characteristics and be produced faster and more efficiently than traditional meat. The technique to generate cultured muscle tissues from stem cells was described long ago, but has not yet been developed for the commercial production of cultured meat products. The technology is at an early stage and prerequisites of implementation include a reasonably high level of consumer acceptance, and the development of commercially-viable means of large scale production. Recent advancements in tissue culture techniques suggest that production may be economically feasible, provided it has physical properties in terms of colour, flavour, aroma, texture and palatability that are comparable to conventional meat. Although considerable progress has been made during recent years, important issues remain to be resolved, including the characterization of social and ethical constraints, the fine-tuning of culture conditions, and the development of culture media that are cost-effective and free of animal products. Consumer acceptance and confidence in in vitro produced cultured meat might be a significant impediment that hinders the marketing process. © 2015 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.","Animalia","Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica",Review,Scopus

European Regulation (which constitutes the highest legal instrument in the hierarchy of European law texts) [EC] No. 1394/2007, published in 2007, uses this term to define somatic cell therapy medicinal products, tissue-engineered products, and gene therapy medicinal products, possibly combined with medical devices. The stated objective was two-fold: both to promote their industrialization and market access, while guaranteeing a high level of health protection for patients. Since publication of the regulation, few marketing authorizations have been granted in Europe, and these have not been accompanied by commercial success. However, certain recent studies show that this is a growing sector and that France remains the leading European nation in terms of clinical trials.

Second, few of these therapies are offered within clinical trials. Third, patients with chronic and debilitating illnesses, who are often the ones who take up these therapies, incur significant financial burdens in the expectation of benefiting from these treatments. Finally, the provision of these stem cell therapies does not follow the established pathways for legitimate medical advancement.

While currently only certain types of blood-forming (hematopoietic) stem cells are used routinely in the treatment of very specific types of blood and immune system disorders, many other proposed approaches are being investigated in clinical trials (Daley, 2012). For example, investigational products derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have entered clinical trials of uses in dry type agerelated macular degeneration and spinal cord injuries, while foetal-derived cells are being tested for the rehabilitation of ischemic stroke patients (Mack, 2011). A number of large-scale efficacy trials with autologous bone-marrow-derived stem cells for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction have either been completed or are underway (Clifford et al., 2012). More than a thousand other registered clinical trials using both allogeneic and autologous sources of somatic (or ‘adult’) stem cells (ASC) are also underway (Li, Atkins and Bubela, 2013), although many of these focus on the use of hematopoietic stem cells for indications they are currently used to treat, such as lymphoma, leukaemia and auto-immune diseases (Daley, 2012). © Bronwyn Parry, Beth Greenhough, Tim Brown and Isabel Dyck 2015.

The National Agency for Health Surveillance (ANVISA) has been the protagonist in structuring the regulation of cell therapy and gene therapy in Brazil, and steps have been taken to ensure quality of these products. However, obstacles such as the commercialization of these therapies and the need to determine whether these products will be regulated following the assumptions adopted in Brazil for drugs and biological products or for human blood and tissues still remain.","bioengineering; blood cell; blood transfusion; bone marrow cell; bone marrow transplantation; Brazil; cell therapy; commercial phenomena; financial management; gene product; gene therapy; government regulation; health survey; hematopoietic stem cell; human; medical ethics; medical research; medical technology; medicolegal aspect; nonhuman; patent; priority journal; quality control; social marketing; standardization; tissue engineering; transgenic organism; animal; biological therapy; Brazil; clinical trial (topic); drug control; drug screening; ethics; gene therapy; legislation and jurisprudence; patient safety; practice guideline; procedures; Animals; Brazil; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug and Narcotic Control; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Genetic Therapy; Humans; Patient Safety; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Quality Control","Springer New York LLC",Book Chapter,Scopus

The aim of cardiac safety pharmacology is to characterise the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic (PK/PD) relationship of a drug’s adverse effects on the heart using continuously evolving methodology. Unlike Toxicology, safety pharmacology includes within its remit a regulatory requirement to predict the risk of rare cardiotoxic (potentially lethal) events such as torsades de pointes (TdP), which is statistically associated with drug-induced changes in the QT interval of the ECG due to blockade of IKr or Kv11.1 current encoded by hERG. This gives safety pharmacology its unique character. The key issues for the safety pharmacology assessment of a drug on the heart are detection of an adverse effect liability, projection of the data into safety margin calculation and clinical safety monitoring. This chapter will briefly review the current cardiac safety pharmacology paradigm outlined in the ICH S7A and ICH S7B guidance documents and the non-clinical models and methods used in the evaluation of new chemical entities in order to define the integrated risk assessment for submission to regulatory authorities. An overview of how the present cardiac paradigm was developed will be discussed, explaining how it was based upon marketing authorisation withdrawal of many non-cardiovascular compounds due to unanticipated proarrhythmic effects. The role of related biomarkers (of cardiac repolarisation, e.g. prolongation of the QT interval of the ECG) will be considered. We will also provide an overview of the ‘non-hERG-centric’ concepts utilised in the evolving comprehensive in vitro proarrhythmia assay (CIPA) that details conduct of the proposed ion channel battery test, use of human stem cells and application of in silico models to early cardiac safety assessment. The summary of our current understanding of the triggers of TdP will include the interplay between action potential (AP) prolongation, early and delayed afterdepolarisation and substrates for re-entry arrhythmias. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.","delayed rectifier potassium channel; inwardly rectifying potassium channel; ion channel; new drug; voltage gated calcium channel; voltage gated potassium channel; ion channel; Article; bioassay; biophysics; channel gating; computer model; drug industry; drug quality; drug safety; drug screening; electrocardiogram; heart arrhythmia; heart atrium; heart depolarization; heart muscle cell; heart muscle fiber membrane potential; heart proarrhythmia; Hodgkin Huxley equation; human; in vitro study; isolated heart; molecular biology; nonhuman; paramedical personnel; pharmacologist; pluripotent stem cell; priority journal; protocol compliance; Purkinje fiber; risk assessment; safety pharmacology; simulation; torsade des pointes; translational research; action potential; animal; drug effects; drug screening; electrocardiography; heart; membrane potential; physiology; Action Potentials; Animals; Biophysics; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Electrocardiography; Heart; Humans; Ion Channels; Membrane Potentials; Molecular Biology","Springer New York LLC",Article,Scopus

In recent years a number of noncardiac drugs have been withdrawn from markets because of cardiotoxicity concerns, while some other drugs have either been withdrawn prior to marketing or required labeling changes that signifi cantly restrict their use. The prediction of arrhythmic risk based on preclinical trials during drug development remains limited despite intensive and costly investigation. Moreover, drug testing using stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes requires a sophisticated platform of sensitive and cell compatible bioanalytical tools with sufficient and accurate recording capacity for key physiological and biochemical changes in the cells. The label-free impedance technology has emerged as a leading platform for detecting spontaneous beating activities of cardiomyocyte. Impedance based assays provide an exceptionally diverse pattern of functional end points, each with the robustness characteristics required to support drug development process and screening.

In this paper, we examine representations of nine major clinics and providers of such treatments on the microblogging network Twitter. We collected and conducted a content analysis of Twitter posts (n = 363) by these establishments and by other users mentioning them, focusing specifically on marketing claims about treatment procedures and outcomes, discussions of safety and efficacy of stem cell transplants, and specific representations of patients’ experiences. Our analysis has shown that there were explicit claims or suggestions of benefits associated with unproven stem cell treatments in approximately one third of the tweets and that patients’ experiences, whenever referenced, were presented as invariably positive and as testimonials about the efficacy of stem cell transplants. Furthermore, the results indicated that the tone of most tweets (60.2 %) was overwhelmingly positive and there were rarely critical discussions about significant health risks associated with unproven stem cell therapies. When placed in the context of past research on the problems associated with the marketing of unproven stem cell therapies, this analysis of representations on Twitter suggests that discussions in social media have also remained largely uncritical of the stem cell tourism phenomenon, with inaccurate representations of risks and benefits for patients. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","human; physiology; procedures; social media; stem cell; stem cell transplantation; Humans; Social Media; Stem Cell Transplantation; Stem Cells","Humana Press Inc.",Review,Scopus

To promote the development of and access to regenerative medicine, it is important to take a balance of expedited provision of innovative therapies and appropriate steps to ensure safety and efficacy. While most developed countries have various regulatory frameworks for clinical trials and medical treatments involving stem cells, the Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine and the Revised Pharmaceutical Affairs Law have recently been simultaneously passed by the Japanese Diet. According to the former act, these medical technologies are categorized into 3 classes depending on their anticipated potential risk to human health, and the specific procedures falling into each class are determined. In addition, the act enables medical institutions to commission cell processing by business facilities outside the institution (even foreign facilities) that fulfill the requirements set out by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, with the aim to promote collaboration between academia and industry from an early stage. According to the latter law, a therapeutic product for regenerative medicine is defined as a product distinct from pharmaceuticals and medical devices, enabling regenerative medical products to be given a conditional, time-limited marketing authorization much earlier than that under the previous system.

It is estimated that CBMs comprise greater than 17% of all bone grafts and bone graft substitutes used.PURPOSE: To critically evaluate CBMs, specifically their technical specifications, existing published data supporting their use, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation, cost, potential pitfalls, and other aspects pertaining to their use.STUDY DESIGN: Areview of literature.METHODS: A series of Ovid, Medline, and Pubmed-National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) searches were performed. Only articles in English journals or published with English language translations were included. Level of evidence of the selected articles was assessed. Specific technical information on each CBM was obtained by direct communication from the companies marketing the individual products.RESULTS: Five different CBMs are currently available for use in spinal fusion surgery. There is a wide variation between the products with regard to the average donor age at harvest, total cellular concentration, percentage of MSCs, shelf life, and cell viability after defrosting. Three retrospective studies evaluating CBMs and fusion have shown fusion rates ranging from 90.2% to 92.3%, and multiple industry-sponsored trials are underway. No independent studies evaluating spinal fusion rates with the use of CBMs exist. All the commercially available CBMs claim to meet the FDA criteria under Section 361, 21 CFR Part 1271, and are not undergoing FDA premarket review. The CBMs claim to provide viable MSCs and are offered at a premium cost. Numerous challenges exist in regard to MSCs' survival, function, osteoblastic potential, and cytokine production once implanted into the intended host.CONCLUSIONS: Cellular bone matrices may be a promising bone augmentation technology in spinal fusion surgery. Although CBMs appear to be safe for use as bone graft substitutes, their efficacy in spinal fusion surgery remains highly inconclusive. Large, nonindustry sponsored studies evaluating the efficacy of CBMs are required. Without results from such studies, surgeons must be made aware of the potential pitfalls of CBMs in spinal fusion surgery. With the currently available data, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of CBMs as bone graft substitutes in spinal fusion surgery. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Ponatinib is the only approved TKI capable of inhibiting BCR-ABL with the gatekeeper T315I kinase domain mutation, known to be the cause for 20% of resistant or relapsed CML cases. In 2013, ponatinib sales were temporarily suspended due to serious side effects seen in nearly 12% of the patient population. These side effects are thought to stem from the potent nature and pan-activity of this TKI.

Big and midsize pharmaceutical companies as an asset class still delay large-scale investments in this arena until technological and market risks will have been further reduced. Nonetheless, a handful of stem cell strategic alliance and licensing transactions have already been implemented, indicating that progress is actively monitored, although most of these involve midsize firms. The greatest difficulty is, perhaps, that the regenerative medicine industry is currently only approaching the point of inflexion of the technology development S-curve, as many more clinical trials read out. A path to accelerating technology adoption is to focus on innovation outliers among healthcare actors. These can be identified by analyzing systemic factors (e.g., national science policies and industry fragmentation) and intrinsic factors (corporate culture, e.g., nimble decision-making structures; corporate finance, e.g., opportunity costs and ownership structure; and operations, e.g., portfolio management strategies, threats on existing businesses and patent expirations). Another path is to accelerate the full clinical translation and commercialization of an allogeneic cytotherapeutic product in any indication to demonstrate the disease-modifying potential of the new products for treatment and prophylaxis, ideally for a large unmet medical need such as dry age-related macular degeneration, or for an orphan disease such as biologics-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease. In times of decreased industry average research productivities, regenerative medicine products provide important prospects for creating new franchises with a market potential that could very well mirror that achieved with the technology of monoclonal antibodies. © 2014 Future Medicine Ltd.","biotechnology; cell therapy; decision making; drug industry; economic evaluation; government regulation; health care policy; hematopoietic stem cell; human; medical research; mesenchymal stem cell; priority journal; regenerative medicine; review; social marketing; stem cell transplantation; strategic planning; allograft; biological therapy; culture technique; drug industry; economics; procedures; stem cell; stem cell transplantation; Allografts; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Drug Industry; Humans; Stem Cell Transplantation; Stem Cells","Future Medicine Ltd.",Review,Scopus

Although most stem cell therapies are new and highly experimental, there are clinics around the world that exploit vulnerable patients with the hope of offering supposed stem cell therapies, many of which operate without credible scientific merit, oversight, or other patient protection. METHODS:: The authors review the potential and the drawbacks of incorporation of stem cells in cosmetic procedures. A review of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved indications and ongoing clinical trials with adipose stem cells is provided. Furthermore, a ""snapshot""analysis of Web sites using the search terms ""stem cell therapy""or ""stem cell treatment""or ""stem cell facelift""was performed. RESULTS:: Despite the protective net cast by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and professional societies such as the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the authors are witnessing worrying advertisements for procedures such as stem cell face lifts, stem cell breast augmentations, and even stem cell vaginal rejuvenation. The marketing and promotion of stem cell procedures in aesthetic surgery is not adequately supported by clinical evidence in the majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS:: Stem cells offer tremendous potential, but the marketplace is saturated with unsubstantiated and sometimes fraudulent claims that may place patients at risk. With plastic surgeons at the forefront of stem cell-based regenerative medicine, it is critically important that they provide an example of a rigorous approach to research, data collection, and advertising of stem cell therapies. © 2014 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeonsy.","economics; esthetic surgery; evidence based medicine; food and drug administration; human; legal aspect; marketing; outcome assessment; rejuvenation; review; stem cell transplantation; United States; Cosmetic Techniques; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Marketing; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Rejuvenation; Stem Cell Transplantation; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins",Article,Scopus

Objectives: The authors sought to characterize the attitudes of plastic surgeons regarding the ethics of stem cell.based aesthetics. Methods: A cross-sectional electronic survey was distributed to 4592 members of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Statements addressed ethical concerns about informed consent, conflicts of interest, advertising, regulation, and stem cell tourism. An agreement score (AS) from 0 to 100 was calculated for each statement. Majority agreement was designated as ≥60 and majority disagreement as ≤40. Results: A total of 770 questionnaires were received (16.7%). The majority of respondents indicated that knowledge regarding the risks and benefits of stem cell procedures is insufficient to obtain valid informed consent (AS, 29) and that direct-to-consumer advertising for these technologies is inappropriate and unethical (AS, 23). Most respondents reported that patients should be actively warned against traveling abroad to receive aesthetic cell therapies (AS, 86) and that registries and evaluations of these clinics should be made publicly available (AS, 71). Even more respondents noted that financial conflicts of interest should be disclosed to patients (AS, 96) and that professional societies should participate in establishing regulatory standards (AS, 93).

However, many critical issues associated mainly with incomplete understanding of stem cell biology and the relevant risk factors, and lack of effective regulations still exist and need to be urgently addressed, especially in countries where establishment of appropriate regulatory system just commenced. More relevantly, the stem cell regulatory sciences need to be established or improved to more effectively evaluate quality, safety and efficacy of stem cell products, and for building up the appropriate regulatory framework.

Areas covered: CiPA consists of three components. The first assay evaluates candidate drug effects on key cardiac ion channels. Then, simulations test whether the channel dataset yields proarrhythmic markers on a computationally reconstructed human ventricular cardiomyocyte action potential. Finally, the relevance of in silico conclusions is verified by determining the electrical activity of human stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes. Expert opinion: The CiPA initiative is intended to move safety pharmacology from a predominantly traditional pharmacodynamics approach to in silico and in vitro drug toxicity assessment. In practice, CiPA assays will have to be compliant with regulatory safety pharmacology tenets. The latter will necessitate international consensus on assay protocols, method standardization and validation and, thus, is likely to involve protracted discussions to achieve agreement. As such, full CiPA implementation by July 2015, as currently envisaged, to supplant E14 guidance for a thorough QT/QTc interval study as prerequisite for noncardiac drug marketing approval, appears to be difficult. Nevertheless, safety stakeholders should do their best to validate and implement the CiPA initiative in the shortest possible time. © Informa UK, Ltd.","arsenic trioxide; astemizole; cisapride; clobutinol; dextropropoxyphene; droperidol; drug metabolite; grepafloxacin; ion channel; ranolazine; sparfloxacin; terfenadine; thioridazine; action potential; assay; comprehensive in vitro proarrhythmia assay; computer model; consensus; drug effect; drug marketing; drug safety; heart muscle cell; heart muscle refractory period; heart proarrhythmia; heart repolarization; heart ventricle arrhythmia; human; in vitro study; ion current; long QT syndrome 5; membrane steady potential; nonhuman; QT interval; QT prolongation; review; Romano-Ward syndrome; standardization; adverse drug reaction; animal; chemically induced; computer simulation; drug approval; drug effects; drug screening; heart arrhythmia; metabolism; pathophysiology; procedures; Action Potentials; Animals; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Computer Simulation; Drug Approval; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Myocytes, Cardiac","Informa Healthcare",Review,Scopus

This historical paper attempts to determine our most important contributors and contributions. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous, 7-question, web-based survey of all members of the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons (ACAPS) and the Southeastern Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons (SESPRS). We asked respondents to list their top 5 most influential surgeons, the most important publications or bodies of work, and the most important innovations in plastic surgery, past and present. RESULTS: Of the 86 nominees from ACAPS, the 15 most influential surgeons of the past century were Tessier, Buncke, Murray, Millard, Gillies, Mathes, Jurkiewicz, Taylor, Converse, Blair, Kleinert, Edgerton, McCraw, Peacock, and Brown, in that order. The most 10 influential surgeons of the current era are Rohrich, McCarthy, Wei, Lee, Siemionow, Allen, Coleman, Guyuron, Serletti, and Nahai. Of the 112 nominees from SESPRS, the 15 most influential surgeons of the past century were Gillies, Millard, Tessier, Buncke, Murray, Jurkiewicz, Hartrampf, Mathes, Taylor, Bostwick, McCraw, Furlow, Converse, Peacock, and Blair, in that order. The 10 most influential surgeons of the current era are Rohrich, Nahai, Wei, McCarthy, Coleman, MacKinnon, McGrath, Rubin, Guyuron, and Hammond. Pooled from both lists, the 10 most influential publications or bodies of work were Hartrampf's TRAM flap, Millard's cleft lip repair, McCraw/Mathes/Nahai's myocutaneous flaps, Furlow's cleft palate repair, Tessier's cleft classification and craniofacial repairs, Ramirez's components separation, Buncke's replantation/toe-to-thumb transfer, McCarthy's mandibular distraction osteogenesis, Taylor's free flap and angiosome concepts, and Murray's kidney transplant. The top 10 innovations of the 20th century were myocutaneous flaps, microsurgery, craniofacial surgery, skin grafts, transplantation, liposuction, bioimplants, distraction osteogenesis, angiosome anatomy, and rigid fixation. The 10 most important, current innovations are hand/face transplantation, fat grafting, stem cells, neurotoxins and soft-tissue fillers, biologic scaffolds, information technology, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, negative pressure wound therapy, perforator flaps, and noninvasive imaging. CONCLUSION: Plastic surgery includes a rich history of both incremental and disruptive innovation, which has endowed our discipline with a competitive advantage over other medical and surgical subspecialties. Based upon our past success in managing change, there may be no limit, or no line on the horizon, as to what is possible, provided that we pursue innovation in a systematic way that combines creativity and discipline.

Even ∼ 50% of patients with relapsed/refractory HL can be cured with high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous stem cell transplantation. However, chemotherapy and radiotherapy cause significant acute and long-term side effects and patients relapsing after HDCT have a dismal prognosis. New drugs are therefore needed to reduce the toxicity of first-line treatments and to increase the efficacy of relapse treatments. Moreover, new drugs are needed for the treatment of older patients with HL because results with current treatments are disappointing. Areas covered: This article discusses promising new drugs for the treatment of classical HL that have been evaluated in the last years.

Thalidomide monotherapy is a secondline option for some patients who relapse after initial chemotherapy. • In 2013, marketing authorisation for subcutaneous bortezomib (Velcade°, Janssen Cilag) provides an opportunity to examine data on its use in multiple myeloma with longer follow-up. • Bortezomib has still not been compared directly with thalidomide in previously untreated patients. The final results of the initial assessment confirmed that survival is prolonged by about one year when bortezomib is added to melphalan + prednisone, a benefit similar to that of thalidomide. • In second-line treatment, the final results of the initial assessment showed that bortezomib prolonged median survival by about 6 months compared with dexamethasone (29.8 months versus 23.7 months). A trial of thalidomide versus bortezomib showed no difference in overall survival (about 21 months). • In an unblinded, randomised, controlled trial, adding bortezomib to the thalidomide + dexamethasone combination did not improve the 2-year survival rate. The median time to disease progression was increased by about 6 months, but there were more cases of severe peripheral neuropathy, severe infections, and severe thrombocytopenia. • In another randomised trial, subcutaneous administration of bortezomib appeared to be as effective as intravenous administration. Subcutaneous administration was also less toxic: 57% of patients experienced serious adverse reactions, compared to 71% of patients treated intravenously. • Bortezomib is a neurotoxic drug: it has been linked to reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome and to dozens of cases of optic neuropathy. In the comparative trial, bortezomib was associated with an excess of neurological disorders and severe infections, while thalidomide was linked to an excess of venous thrombosis and stroke. There is a higher risk of pharmacokinetic interactions with bortezomib than with thalidomide. • In practice, in late 2013, the melphalan + prednisone + thalidomide combination remains the standard treatment for multiple myeloma when haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is not feasible. Bortezomib, preferably by the subcutaneous route, is an option for patients in whom thalidomide fails. ©Prescrire.","bortezomib; dexamethasone; melphalan; prednisone; thalidomide; article; cerebrovascular accident; disease course; drug treatment failure; follow up; human; infection; multiple myeloma; neurologic disease; optic nerve disease; overall survival; peripheral neuropathy; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; thrombocytopenia; vein thrombosis","Association Mieux Prescrire",Article,Scopus

G-CSF facilitates restoration of neutrophil counts, decreases incidence of infection/febrile neutropenia and reduces resource utilization. G-CSF is also widely used to mobilize peripheral blood stem cells for hematopoietic transplant. Areas covered: We review the therapeutic use, cost effectiveness and disease impact of G-CSF for neutropenia, development of G-CSF biosimilars and current next-generation discovery efforts. Expert opinion: G-CSF has impacted the treatment and survival of patients with congenital neutropenias. For chemotherapy-associated neutropenia, cost effectiveness and impact on survival are still unclear. G-CSFs are expensive and require systemic administration. Market entry of new biosimilars, some with enhanced half-life profiles, will probably reduce cost and increase cost effectiveness. There is no evidence that marketed or late development biosimilars display effectiveness superior to current G-CSFs. Second-generation compounds that mimic the activity of G-CSF at its receptor, induce endogenous ligand(s) or offer adjunct activity have been reported and represent attractive G-CSF alternatives, but are in preclinical stages. A significant therapeutic advance will require reduced depth and duration of neutropenia compared to current G-CSFs. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.","balugrastim; biosimilar agent; cytarabine; da 3031; ep 2006; ep2006; erythropoietin receptor; ezatiostat; gcpgc; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; human serum albumin; krn 125; krn125; la ep 2006; la ep2006; leridistim; maxy g 34; maxy g34; milodistim; monoclonal antibody; recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor; spi 2012; unclassified drug; acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis; acute lung injury; acute on chronic liver failure; antibiotic prophylaxis; bone marrow suppression; cancer survival; chemotherapy induced neutropenia; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; disease duration; dose densification; drug dose intensification; drug efficacy; drug half life; drug marketing; drug safety; Escherichia coli; event free survival; evidence based practice; febrile neutropenia; health care policy; hematopoietic stem cell; hospitalization cost; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; idiopathic chronic neutropenia; incidence; kidney clearance; law; licensing; meta analysis (topic); multicenter study (topic); Mycobacterium intracellulare avium; myelodysplastic syndrome; neutrophil count; nonhuman; overall survival; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); plasma half life; protein clearance; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; spleen rupture; stem cell; vascular disease; Animals; Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals; Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor; Humans; Neutropenia",,Review,Scopus

Currently, these concerns and requirements are addressed in a time phased manner, attempting to match the advance of spending rate on assessing safety issues in alignment with advancing the moiety through development of the therapeutics.This article seeks to communicate all the critical but frequently overlooked aspects of current and pending regulatory requirements including the lesser known parts associated with impurities, active metabolites, and distribution of active components to (and subsequent clearance from) the population brain.While there are some exciting developments in treating CNS diseases with stem cells and some protein based therapies ( Aboody et al., 2011), drugs meant to favorably effect, prevent, or cure a disease process within the central nervous system (CNS) are primarily small molecule and must meet a number of regulatory and scientifically mandated criteria to establish that their safety in clinical use is acceptable. This is initially done in in vivo animals or in in vitro preparations. The starting place for such nonclinical safety assessment requires some fundamental assumptions about the potential therapeutic ( Ball et al., 2007; Gad, 2009; ICH S6, 2004; ICH M3 (R2), 2008). The first assumption is that the primary intended route of therapeutic administration is oral, as is indeed the case for the vast majority of both current and for most potential new drugs. Most aspects of nonclinical safety assessment do not depend on route, and we will consider the situations where the use of other routes influences requirements for nonclinical safety assessment, and why.A second general case assumption in the usual case is that drug administration frequency (or regimen) is once daily, though this assumption is less frequently made (in real life) than the oral route assumption.Regulations, costs, and acceptance of risks ( Enna and Williams, 2009) along with adherence to the phased process of clinical drug development have caused the task or flow of performances of regulatory nonclinical safety assessment studies to be considered as occurring in three sequential parts (once the initial candidate screening and lead selection phase are complete). These are the studies (1) done to allow initiation of clinical trials, (2) done to allow initiation of clinical trials sufficient to support a marketing application, and (3) required to allow a marketing application. Employment of new technologies, such as in vivo imaging has aided, to both help understand specificity of delivery to target tissue sites and mechanisms of both action and undesirable actions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","central nervous system agents; drug metabolite; developmental toxicity; drug abuse; drug carcinogenicity; drug control; drug cost; drug impurity; drug industry; drug legislation; drug metabolism; drug monitoring; drug research; drug safety; drug screening; drug tolerability; experimental animal; gene mutation; genotoxicity; good laboratory practice; good manufacturing practice; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; mutagen testing; nonhuman; priority journal; reproductive toxicity; review; risk assessment; risk factor; toxicity testing; toxicokinetics; Central Nervous System Agents; Drug Approval; Drug Discovery; Humans",,Review,Scopus

As such there are gaps in regulatory and manufacturing frameworks and technologies, only a small number of products are currently within late phase clinical trials and few products have achieved commercialization.Growing pointsRecent developments are encouraging acceleration through the difficulties encountered en route to clinical trials and commercialization of stem cell therapies.Areas timely for developing researchThe field is growing year on year with the first clinical trial using induced pluripotent stem cells anticipated by end 2013. © The Author 2013.","remestemcel L; acute graft versus host disease; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; article; case study; cell differentiation; clinical assessment; clinical pathway; clinical trial (topic); drug efficacy; drug safety; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; marketing; priority journal; product development; regenerative medicine; Article; autologous stem cell transplantation; differentiation; human; stem cell; stem cell transplantation; study design; clinical trial; commercialisation; regenerative medicine; regulation; stem cell-based therapy; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Europe; Genetic Therapy; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Japan; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Transplantation; United States",,Article,Scopus

This gap analysis has reviewed and critically assessed enduring issues and new challenges emerging from recent research, and proposes strategies for translating solutions into practice.Methods: More than 100 internationally recognised specialist breast cancer scientists, clinicians and healthcare professionals collaborated to address nine thematic areas: genetics, epigenetics and epidemiology; molecular pathology and cell biology; hormonal influences and endocrine therapy; imaging, detection and screening; current/novel therapies and biomarkers; drug resistance; metastasis, angiogenesis, circulating tumour cells, cancer 'stem' cells; risk and prevention; living with and managing breast cancer and its treatment. The groups developed summary papers through an iterative process which, following further appraisal from experts and patients, were melded into this summary account.Results: The 10 major gaps identified were: (1) understanding the functions and contextual interactions of genetic and epigenetic changes in normal breast development and during malignant transformation; (2) how to implement sustainable lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and weight) and chemopreventive strategies; (3) the need for tailored screening approaches including clinically actionable tests; (4) enhancing knowledge of molecular drivers behind breast cancer subtypes, progression and metastasis; (5) understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumour heterogeneity, dormancy, de novo or acquired resistance and how to target key nodes in these dynamic processes; (6) developing validated markers for chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity; (7) understanding the optimal duration, sequencing and rational combinations of treatment for improved personalised therapy; (8) validating multimodality imaging biomarkers for minimally invasive diagnosis and monitoring of responses in primary and metastatic disease; (9) developing interventions and support to improve the survivorship experience; (10) a continuing need for clinical material for translational research derived from normal breast, blood, primary, relapsed, metastatic and drug-resistant cancers with expert bioinformatics support to maximise its utility. The proposed infrastructural enablers include enhanced resources to support clinically relevant in vitro and in vivo tumour models; improved access to appropriate, fully annotated clinical samples; extended biomarker discovery, validation and standardisation; and facilitated cross-discipline working.Conclusions: With resources to conduct further high-quality targeted research focusing on the gaps identified, increased knowledge translating into improved clinical care should be achievable within five years. © 2013 Eccles et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","afatinib; ATM protein; biological marker; BRCA1 protein; BRCA2 protein; checkpoint kinase 2; denosumab; everolimus; fenretinide; ganetespib; goserelin; lapatinib; lasofoxifene; letrozole; luminespib; metformin; neratinib; paclitaxel; pertuzumab; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; protein kinase LKB1; protein p53; raloxifene; resveratrol; saracatinib; tamoxifen; trastuzumab; uvomorulin; aromatase inhibitor; lapatinib; luminespib; retinoid; tamoxifen; abdominal obesity; advanced cancer; alcohol consumption; allele; angiogenesis; article; behavior change; bioinformatics; body composition; body weight; bone metastasis; breast cancer; breast development; breast metastasis; breast reconstruction; caloric restriction; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer epidemiology; cancer genetics; cancer hormone therapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer prognosis; cancer risk; cancer survival; cancer susceptibility; cell death; cell lineage; cell polarity; chemosensitivity; circulating tumor cell; clinical decision making; cognitive therapy; cost effectiveness analysis; cytology; distant metastasis; DNA damage; drug efficacy; epigenetics; epithelial mesenchymal transition; exercise; fat intake; fine needle aspiration biopsy; gene expression; genetic association; genetic predisposition; genetic screening; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genotype; hormonal therapy; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; lifestyle modification; longevity; low drug dose; lymphangiogenesis; malignant transformation; mastectomy; medical research; meta analysis (topic); micrometastasis; molecularly targeted therapy; monotherapy; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patient satisfaction; personalized medicine; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); physical activity; positron emission tomography; psychological well being; quality of life; radiofrequency ablation; radiosensitivity; randomized controlled trial (topic); signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; smoking; social marketing; stereotactic body radiation therapy; terminal care; translational research; tumor microenvironment; tumor xenograft; animal; breast tumor; female; research; review; translational research; Article; bone metastasis; breast cancer; cancer classification; cancer prevention; cancer radiotherapy; cancer resistance; cancer screening; cancer stem cell; cancer survivor; central nervous system metastasis; decision making; diet therapy; drug effect; genetic risk; kinesiotherapy; molecular dynamics; social psychology; treatment planning; tumor immunology; tumor suppressor gene; weight gain; weight reduction; Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Research; Translational Medical Research",,Article,Scopus

In support of this new form of treatment, a global multibillion-dollar research endeavor is currently underway in an effort to establish a scientific evidence base for safe and effective clinical use of stem cells. At present, due to its early stages, only a few stem cell therapies are approved for use. Yet despite very limited evidence-based data, a proliferation of questionable and often illegal stem cell providers around the world are now offering unfettered access to largely experimental stem cell treatment claiming cures for virtually any disease or condition. These stem cell clinics promote their services globally to patients using unregulated Internet and forms of direct-to-consumer advertising. In this paper we examine marketing characteristics of these questionable stem cell clinics and discuss pathways of access through the globalization of medical tourism. We conclude with an examination of the similarities between unproven stem cell therapy access and illicit online pharmacies and explore possible lessons that can be learned to inform future global regulation and policymaking in this arena.","Cell-based therapy; Direct-to-consumer advertisings; Global regulation; Medical tourism; Online pharmacies; Regenerative medicine; Scientific evidence; Stem cell therapy; Internet; Marketing; Medicine; Public policy; Stem cells; biological product; prescription drug; advertizing; cell proliferation; clinical practice; conference paper; consumer health information; disease transmission; health care access; health care policy; health hazard; health insurance; human; Internet; medical tourism; pharmacy; social marketing; stem cell transplantation; treatment indication",,Conference Paper,Scopus

Aim: To provide an overview of the development of biosimilars worldwide. Methods: Literature review of manufacturing processes of biosimilars, differences and similarities between biosimilars and the reference product, approval pathways for biosimilars, challenges in clinical trial study design and available data from clinical trials. Results: Biosimilars have the same amino acid sequence and highly similar glycosylation patterns that overlap with the originator product. Both efficacy and toxicity are difficult to predict due to subtle molecular changes that might have profound effects on clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Their main advantage is related to cost savings. Direct evidence of safety and benefit from clinical trials, post-marketing pharmacoviligance and unequivocal identification of the product as a biosimilar are requirements before approval. Non-inferiority or equivalence trials are required by regulatory agencies. Over the past years, several biosimilars have been approved such as erythropoietin or growth factors. Recently, two monoclonal antibodies, Remsima and Inflectra, have been shown to be equivalent to infliximab (INX) in safety and efficacy in rheumatologic conditions. Interchangeability, automatic substitution and switching are key issues when treating patients with biosimilars in clinical practice. Conclusions: Biosimilars represent a new generation of drugs in liver and gastrointestinal diseases. On June 27, 2013, Hospira's Inflectra (INX) was the first biosimilar monoclonal antibody to receive positive opinion from European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and plaque psoriasis. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","adalimumab; antineoplastic agent; avent; b 1695501; biosimilar agent; ct p 13; ep 2006; etanercept; folic acid; glyceryl trinitrate; gp 2013; hd 203; hemoglobin; hexal; human growth hormone; infliximab; interferon; lbec 0101; methotrexate; neutralizing antibody; peginterferon; pf 06410293; pld 108; pr x 106; recombinant erythropoietin; recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor; ribavirin; rituximab; sb 309; silapro; tunex; unclassified drug; xm 02; agranulocytosis; amino acid sequence; ankylosing spondylitis; area under the curve; autoimmune disease; binding affinity; bioequivalence; chronic lymphatic leukemia; comparative effectiveness; cost control; drug approval; drug bioavailability; drug efficacy; drug indication; drug manufacture; drug safety; drug surveillance program; drug tolerability; engraftment; food and drug administration; gastrointestinal disease; glycosylation; hepatitis C; human; immunogenicity; liver disease; neutropenia; nonhodgkin lymphoma; nonhuman; pharmaceutical equivalence; priority journal; registration; review; rheumatoid arthritis; stem cell mobilization; study design; therapeutic equivalence; unspecified side effect; Animals; Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Approval; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Liver Diseases",,Review,Scopus

Biosimilars of filgrastim, based on the originator product Neupogen®, have been available since 2008 and are now in widespread clinical use in Europe and elsewhere. Three biosimilar G-CSFs have been approved based on a combination of physicochemical and biological protein characterisation, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessment in healthy volunteers and efficacy and safety data in patients with cancer. To assess whether biosimilars are effective in the real-world clinical practice setting, a pooled analysis of five post-approval studies of biosimilar G-CSF (Zarzio®) that included 1,302 adult patients who received at least one cycle of chemotherapy with G-CSF support for the prevention of neutropenia was conducted. A total of 36 % of patients had a febrile neutropenia risk of >20 %, while 39.6 % had a risk of 10-20 % based on chemotherapy regimen. The occurrence of severe or febrile neutropenia was within the range of that observed in previous studies of originator G-CSF. In addition, the safety profile of Zarzio® was consistent with that reported for originator G-CSF and the known safety profile of G-CSF. Initial concerns about the use of biosimilars, at least with regard to biosimilar G-CSFs, appear to be unfounded. Adoption of cost-effective biosimilars should help reduce healthcare costs and improve patient access to biological treatments. © 2013 The Author(s).","antineoplastic agent; docetaxel; doxorubicin; recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor; unclassified drug; xm 02; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; bioequivalence; bladder cancer; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer staging; CD34 selection; clinical practice; colorectal cancer; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; disease severity; drug approval; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; drug indication; drug marketing; drug quality; drug substitution; drug surveillance program; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; endometrium cancer; Europe; febrile neutropenia; health care access; health care cost; hematologic malignancy; human; immune response; leukemia; lung cancer; lymphoma; multiple myeloma; neutropenia; ovary cancer; pharmacodynamics; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); physical chemistry; primary prevention; priority journal; prostate cancer; review; risk assessment; secondary prevention; solid tumor; stem cell mobilization; Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Europe; Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor; Humans; Neoplasms; Neutropenia",,Review,Scopus

The objective of this analysis was to develop a population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model to characterize the time-course of peginesatide plasma and hemoglobin concentrations following intravenous and subcutaneous administration. Plasma samples (n = 2,665) from 672 patients with chronic kidney disease (on or not on dialysis) and hemoglobin samples (n = 18,857) from 517 hemodialysis patients (subset of the 672 patients), were used for pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model development in NONMEM VI. The pharmacokinetic profile of peginesatide was best described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and saturable elimination. The relationship between peginesatide and hemoglobin plasma concentrations was best characterized by a modified precursor-dependent lifespan indirect response model. The estimate of maximal stimulatory effect of peginesatide on the endogenous production rate of progenitor cells (Emax) was 0.54. The estimate of peginesatide drug concentration required for 50% of maximal response (EC50) estimates was 0.4 μg/mL.

The drugs are safe, weight neutral and widely prescribed. There are currently eight gliptins registered worldwide with several more in advanced stages of development. Areas covered: The place of the gliptins in the treatment algorithm of type 2 diabetes is discussed as well as unique features of the individual drugs. The gliptins may possess cardiovascular protective effects and their administration may promote β-cell survival; claims currently being evaluated in clinical and preclinical studies. The global market revenues and future prospects of the gliptins are discussed and the gliptins in Phases II and III of development are reviewed. Expert opinion: The gliptins are an optional second-line therapy after metformin; they are generally well tolerated with low risk of hypoglycemia. The various compounds differ with respect to their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties; however, their clinical efficacy appears to be similar. The clinical differences between the various compounds stem from effects other than hypoglycemic effects, their safety and side effects profile. The currently registered compounds appear to have maximized the clinical potential of DPP-4 inhibition, and the new compounds in the companies' pipelines seem to be as effective as the ones presently in use. There are two gliptins in advanced stages of development which will be registered for once-weekly dosing, possibly increasing patient adherence to therapy. Several individual gliptins are being evaluated for treatment in diabetes subpopulations such as type 1 patients or adolescents. © Informa UK, Ltd.","alogliptin; anagliptin; da 1229; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; evogliptin; exendin 4; gemigliptin; glucagon like peptide 1; gosogliptin; incretin; linagliptin; melogliptin; metformin; omarigliptin; pioglitazone; saxagliptin; sitagliptin; teneligliptin; trelagliptin; unclassified drug; vildagliptin; antidiabetic activity; area under the curve; caloric intake; carbohydrate metabolism; cell survival; diarrhea; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug elimination; drug half life; drug marketing; drug safety; drug tolerability; gastrointestinal symptom; glycemic control; human; hypoglycemia; insulin release; lifestyle modification; monotherapy; nausea; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; patient compliance; polypharmacy; review; stomach emptying; vomiting; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Humans",,Review,Scopus

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Cervi cornus Colla (CCC) on the stem cell activity and epidermal differentiation in the reconstruction of skin equivalent. Four different models were constructed according to different composition of dermal substitute. Results showed similar morphologic findings when hyaluronic acid (HA) and/or CCC was added. But, immunohistochemical staining showed that p63 was significantly increased by addition of HA and/or CCC. Increased staining of integrin α6 and β1 was variably observed when HA and/or CCC was added to make dermal substitute. These finding showed that addition of HA and/or CCC may affect the stem cell activity in the reconstruction of skin. Furthermore, filaggrin expression was much increased when CCC was added. It showed that epidermal differentiation was significantly improved by addition of CCC. In conclusion, simultaneous presence of HA and CCC contributed to the stem cell activity and epidermal differentiation in the reconstruction of SE. Legislation in the EU prohibits marketing cosmetics and personal care products that contain constituents that have been examined through animal experiments. To avoid these limitations, SEs can be used for testing the safety or the efficacy of cosmetic ingredients. Therefore, our results showed that combined use of HA and CCC can be helpful for the reconstruction of SE with good stem cell activity and epidermal differentiation. © 2013 Society of Cosmetic Scientists and the Société Française de Cosmétologie.","alpha6 integrin; beta1 integrin; hyaluronic acid; protein p63; adolescent; article; cell activity; cell differentiation; Cervi cornus Colla; child; deer antler glue; epidermis; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; medicinal plant; school child; stem cell; Animals; Antlers; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Deer; Epidermis; Humans",,Article,Scopus

Two pharmacodynamic (PD) studies were conducted to compare the PD profiles of TKN732, a filgrastim biosimilar, with filgrastim Gran® syringe, marketed in Japan. TKN732 is manufactured from the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as XM02 which is approved by EMA and FDA. Methods: PD-SC300 single-dose study was performed to examine the equivalence of the effects of the drugs in increasing the neutrophil count. It was a randomized, single-blind, two-period, cross-over, two-arm study with a three-week wash-out period. Thirty-six healthy male subjects were randomized and received a single subcutaneous dose of 300 μg/body of TKN732 or Gran® syringe, with subsequent crossover. The absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were determined with an automated hematology analyzer. The primary PD (ANC AUEC 0-96h and ANCmax) variables were considered equivalent if the 95% confidence intervals were in the range of 80-125%. PD-SC300 repeated-dose study was performed to examine the equivalence of the drugs in mobilizing hematopoietic stem cells. It was a randomized, single-blind, two-period, crossover, two-arm study with a 23-day wash-out period. Sixty healthy male subjects were randomized and received five daily subcutaneous doses of 300μg/body/day of TKN732 or Gran® syringe, with subsequent crossover. The CD34-positive cell count (CD34+) in the peripheral blood was determined by single-platform flow cytometry assay. Equivalence of the primary PD (CD34+ AUEC0-144h and CD34+max) variables was assessed as in the single-dose study. Results: Thirty-five subjects completed the PD-SC300 single-dose study, and 56 subjects completed the PD-SC300 repeated-dose study. Statistic equivalence between the two products was demonstrated for the PD parameters in each study. The incidence of adverse events was the same with the two drugs. TKN732 was well tolerated, with no additional safety concerns compared with Gran®. Conclusion: The study results demonstrated the equivalence of TKN732 and the reference drug, Gran®, in terms of their PD and safety profiles.","recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor; tkn 732; unclassified drug; article; comparative study; confidence interval; controlled study; crossover procedure; drug manufacture; drug marketing; drug safety; drug tolerability; flow cytometry; food and drug administration; hematology test kit; hematopoietic stem cell; human; human experiment; male; neutrophil count; normal human; pharmaceutical equivalence; pharmacodynamics; randomized controlled trial; single blind procedure; stem cell mobilization; unspecified side effect",,Article,Scopus

This review evaluates the impact of the WR mechanism on the development of oncology drugs in children. Methods: A search of the FDA document archiving, reporting, and regulatory tracking system was performed for January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2010. Drugs were identified and pediatric-specific labeling information was obtained from Drugs@fda.gov and FDA Pediatric Labeling Changes Table. Results: Fifty WRs have been issued for oncology drugs. Pediatric studies have been submitted for 14 drugs. Thirteen received pediatric exclusivity. As of December 31, 2010, labeling changes have been made for 11 drugs. Three drugs were approved for pediatric use. Conclusion: WRs have provided a mechanism to promote the study of drugs in pediatric malignancies. Information from studies resulting from the WRs regarding safety, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of oncology drugs has been incorporated into pediatric labeling for 11/14 of the drugs. Earlier communication and collaboration between the FDA, National Cancer Institute, clinical investigators, and commercial sponsors are envisioned to facilitate the identification and prioritization of emerging new drugs of interest for WR consideration.

Since the expiration of the filgrastim patent in Europe, three agents have received marketing authorization from the EMA: Tevagrastim, Zarzio and Nivestim. Tevagrastim has also been approved as a biologic by the FDA as tbo-filgrastim. Areas covered: Using the EMA dossiers (all three agents), the FDA dossier (Tevagrastim), and journal publications, this article reviews clinical safety data for these products with emphasis on serious/severe adverse events and special consideration of immunogenicity, bone pain, splenomegaly, allergic reactions, acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality. Expert opinion: All three agents have similar safety profiles. None were statistically higher on safety parameters to what is known about originator filgrastim (Neupogen). What is known about filgrastim in general regarding safety can be extended to biosimilar filgrastim. Safety profiles may become more differentiated once long-term product-specific safety data are available. Large-sample, long-term, observational studies of real-world practice will provide the heterogeneity and statistical power to demonstrate product-specific safety profiles.

The potential for new drugs in this arena is vast, as not only a high number of LSDs have no available therapy, but also alternative therapeutic approaches for diseases with existing treatment are much needed as a number of challenges facing the existing therapies have become very obvious. A significant unmet medical need is therefore apparent for most, if not all of the LSDs and the development of new therapies based on the increasing knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in these devastating diseases is therefore anticipated with great interest from all stakeholders. Areas covered: The reader will be introduced to the intricate biological processes involved in lysosomal regulation and how these are exploited for current and emerging therapies. Therapies utilizing these processes will be thoroughly reviewed with regard to their mechanism of action, their clinical status and the challenges they are faced with and/or are aiming to address. For this review, a literature research has been undertaken that covers the years 1955-2012. Expert opinion: The interest in lysosomal biology and disease has surged over the past decade not only in the halls of science but also of pharmaceutical companies. As the complexity of the LSDs increasingly become revealed, so do novel therapeutic targets continuously nurturing the development of new candidate drugs for these devastating diseases. Among this multitude of approaches, the ERTs still account for the vast majority of approved therapies but a number of exciting alternative approaches are emerging targeting various components of the pathophysiological cascade. This evolution of the field is much needed as the presently available treatments are unable to address all clinical aspects of these multifaceted diseases. Future therapy will most likely consist of combinations of these established and emerging approaches as well as other yet to be discovered concepts as the complexity of the diseases demands a certain degree of humbleness to the expectations for a cure based on a single therapy. © Informa UK, Ltd.","agalsidase alfa; agalsidase beta; chaperone; galsulfase; iduronate 2 sulfatase; imiglucerase; laronidase; lysosome associated membrane protein; mercaptamine; miglustat; recombinant glucan 1,4 alpha glucosidase; taliglucerase alfa; velaglucerase alfa; autophagy; biosynthesis; blood brain barrier; cystinosis; drug development; drug efficacy; drug industry; drug marketing; drug tolerability; endocytosis; enzyme activity; enzyme replacement; exocytosis; Fabry disease; Gaucher disease; gene therapy; genotype phenotype correlation; glycogen storage disease type 2; health care need; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; Hunter syndrome; Hurler syndrome; immunosuppressive treatment; in vitro study; in vivo study; lysosome; lysosome storage disease; Maroteaux Lamy syndrome; monotherapy; morbidity; mortality; nonhuman; pathophysiology; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); review; substrate reduction therapy; therapy; trans Golgi network; transcytosis","Informa Healthcare",Review,Scopus

Approved compounds ganciclovir (GCV), foscarnet (FOS) and cidofovir (CDV) are limited by toxicity and evolving resistance in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity. New substances with new mechanisms of action and lesser toxicity issues are required. Maribavir (MBV) is a benzimidazole l-riboside and acts as a competitive inhibitor of the HCMV UL97 protein. MBV was discovered at the University of Michigan and originally developed by GlaxoSmithKline. In 2003, the substance was licensed to ViroPharma. The drug is orally applicable and exhibited antiviral potency against different HCMV strains including strains resistant to GCV, CDV and FOS. Areas covered: This article examines the published pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy data from Phase I, Phase II and Phase III studies as well reports of antiviral resistance. Expert opinion: Although MBV exhibits a desired new mechanism of action, the compound showed limitations in recent Phase III clinical trials. Proposed explanations include an inadequate dosing regimen and choice of study endpoint. Therefore, MBV deserves further systematic evaluation and its optimal dose has to be determined. Hence, the results of the new Phase II study with different doses of MBV for treatment of HCMV will be a crucial milestone. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.","1263w 94; benzimidavir; unclassified drug; vp 41263; antiviral resistance; article; cellular immunity; cytomegalovirus infection; diarrhea; drug bioavailability; drug marketing; drug metabolism; drug safety; drug tolerability; headache; human; IC 50; immunopathology; infection prevention; nausea; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); rash; taste disorder","Informa Healthcare",Article,Scopus

It will also enable academic investigators, local regulators, and national and international biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies to accelerate stem cell-based clinical research that could lead to effective innovative treatments in these regions. Using India as a model system and obtaining input from regulators, clinicians, academics, and industry representatives across the stem cell field in India, we reviewed the role of key agencies and processes involved in this field. We have identified areas that need attention and here provide solutions from other established and functioning models in the world to streamline and unify the regulatory and ethics approval processes for cell-based therapies. We also make recommendations to check the growth and functioning of clinics offering unproven treatments. Addressing these issues will remove considerable hurdles to both local and international investigators, accelerate the pace of research and development, and create a quality environment for reliable products to emerge.

Material and Method: A systematic literature search was performed for original articles published from January 2007 until May 2012. Results: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria for phase I or II clinical trials, of which three used stem cells as vehicles, two trials used autologous hematopoetic stem cells and in four trials cancer stem cells were targeted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were applied as cellular vehicles to transfer therapeutic agents. Cell therapy with MSC can successfully target resistant cancers. Cancer stem cells were selectively targeted via a proteasome-dependent suicide gene leading to tumor regression. Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway has been also evidenced to be an attractive CSC-target. Conclusions: This systematic review focused on two different concepts of stem cells and breast cancer marking a turning point in the trials that applied stem cells as cellular vehicles for targeted delivery therapy as well as CSC-targeted therapies. Applying stem cells as targeted therapy could be an effective therapeutic approach for treatment of breast cancer in the clinic and in therapeutic marketing; however this needs to be confirmed with further clinical investigations.","antineoplastic agent; beta catenin; drug carrier; Wnt protein; biological therapy; Breast Neoplasms; cancer stem cell; female; hematopoietic stem cell; human; mesenchymal stroma cell; Wnt signaling pathway; Antineoplastic Agents; beta Catenin; Breast Neoplasms; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Drug Carriers; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Mesenchymal Stromal Cells; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Wnt Proteins; Wnt Signaling Pathway","Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention",Article,Scopus

In the beginning stages of the disease it demonstrated a modest efficacy by prolonging survival for a few months. Although the physiopathological mechanisms of this disease have not been totally solved, the progression of knowledge in recent years in this area led to the development of a large number of neuroprotective agents which showed effective results in animal models of ALS and which could be good candidates for the treatment of ALS.

The basis for the approval is to show the similarity sufficient to ensure the same quality, safety and efficacy as the reference medicine. In oncology, the most widely used among so far registered follow-on biologics are biosimilar granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, and in the hitherto clinical practice, there have been no concerns about their effectiveness and safety. It is expected that along with the patent expiry of next biologics, the number of follow-on biologics will increasingly grow, that implies the need to develop and implement specific regulations for this new class of medicine.","antineoplastic agent; biosimilar agent; ep 2006; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; human growth hormone; pld 108; recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor; unclassified drug; xm 02; autoimmune disease; biological therapy; clinical trial (topic); DNA recombination; drug approval; drug control; drug efficacy; drug marketing; drug quality; drug safety; glycosylation; government regulation; hematopoietic cell; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; immunogenicity; neoplasm; neutropenia; nomenclature; patent; patient information; practice guideline; pure red cell anemia; review; virus infection",,Review,Scopus

One challenge for this approach is obtaining a collection of suitable cell lines derived from ethnically diverse populations. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) seem ideal for this purpose. They can be obtained from any individual, can be differentiated into multiple relevant cell types, and their self-renewal capability makes it possible to generate large quantities of quality-controlled cell types.

Recently, several studies have demonstrated potential advantages for stem-cell-based therapies in regenerative treatments. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are now an excellent candidate for tissue replacement therapies, and tissue engineering approaches and chair-side cellular grafting approaches using autologous MSCs represent the clinical state of the art for stem-cell-based alveolar bone regeneration. Basic studies have revealed that crosstalk between implanted donor cells and recipient immune cells plays a key role in determining clinical success that may involve the recently observed immunomodulatory properties of MSCs. Part II of this review first overviews progress in regenerative dentistry to consider the implications of the stem cell technology in dentistry and then highlights cutting-edge stem-cell-based alveolar bone regenerative therapies. Factors that affect stem-cell-based bone regeneration as related to the local immune response are then discussed. Additionally, pre-clinical stem cell studies for the regeneration of teeth and other oral organs as well as possible applications of MSC-based immunotherapy in dentistry are outlined.

This analysis also breaks down the commercial advantages of each cell-based approach, comparing both cost of goods and the ideal indication type for each. While allogeneic therapies have considerable advantages over autologous therapies, they do have a distinct disadvantage regarding potential immunogenicity. The introduction of the hybrid autologous business model provides the ability for autologous-based therapies to mitigate some of the advantages that allogeneic cell-based therapies enjoy, including cost of goods.

Canadians travel abroad for orthopaedic surgery, bariatric surgery, ophthalmologic surgery, stem cell injections, "" Liberation therapy"" for multiple sclerosis, and additional interventions. Both responding to public interest in medical travel and playing an important part in promoting the notion of a global marketplace for health services, many Canadian companies market medical travel.Methods: Research began with the goal of locating all medical tourism companies based in Canada. Various strategies were used to find such businesses. During the search process it became apparent that many Canadian business promoting medical travel are not medical tourism companies. To the contrary, numerous types of businesses promote medical travel. Once businesses promoting medical travel were identified, content analysis was used to extract information from company websites. Company websites were analyzed to establish: 1) where in Canada these businesses are located; 2) the destination countries and health care facilities that they market; 3) the medical procedures they promote; 4) core marketing messages; and 5) whether businesses market air travel, hotel accommodations, and holiday tours in addition to medical procedures.Results: Searches conducted from 2006 to 2011 resulted in identification of thirty-five Canadian businesses currently marketing various kinds of medical travel. The research project began with what seemed to be the straightforward goal of establishing how many medical tourism companies are based in Canada. Refinement of categories resulted in the identification of eighteen businesses fitting the category of what most researchers would identify as medical tourism companies. Seven other businesses market regional, cross-border health services available in the United States and intranational travel to clinics in Canada. In contrast to medical tourism companies, they do not market holiday tours in addition to medical care. Two companies occupy a narrow market niche and promote testing for CCSVI and "" Liberation therapy"" for multiple sclerosis. Three additional companies offer bariatric surgery and cosmetic surgery at facilities in Mexico. Four businesses offer health insurance products intended to cover the cost of obtaining privately financed health care in the U.S. These businesses also help their clients arrange treatment beyond Canada's borders. Finally, one medical travel company based in Canada markets health services primarily to U.S. citizens.Conclusions: This article uses content analysis of websites of Canadian companies marketing medical travel to provide insight into Canada's medical travel industry. The article reveals a complex marketplace with different types of companies taking distinct approaches to marketing medical travel. © 2012 Turner; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","environmental economics; globalization; health care; health insurance; health services; market system; marketing; tourism development; article; bariatric surgery; Canada; esthetic surgery; health care cost; health care facility; health care industry; health care policy; Internet; marketing; medical care; medical tourism; Mexico; multiple sclerosis; priority journal; travel; United States; financial management; health care delivery; health care quality; human; information processing; Canada; Canada; Data Collection; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Internet; Marketing of Health Services; Medical Tourism; Quality of Health Care",,Article,Scopus

Clearly, the accomplishment of such objectives requires the strong commitment and cooperation of different professional figures including, but not limited to, pharmacologists, oncologists and cardiologists. The aspect of anticancer drug cardiotoxicity seems to be somehow underestimated, mainly due to inadequate reporting of adverse reactions from oncology drugs in the post-marketing setting.

LHRH receptors are expressed in about 80% of human endometrial and ovarian cancers, 86% of prostate cancer, and about 50% of breast cancers including triple-negative breast cancer, as well as bladder, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, sarcomas, lymphomas, melanomas, and renal cell carcinomas. Apart from the pituitary and reproductive organs, other organs and hematopoietic stem cells express LHRH receptors. Thus, a targeted cytotoxic LHRH analog such as AEZS-108 (formerly known as AN-152), in which doxorubin is linked to the LHRH agonist [D-Lys 6]LHRH, appears to be a suitable drug for targeted chemotherapy of cancers expressing receptors for LHRH, which would be more efficacious and less toxic than standard systemic chemotherapy. Areas covered: This review discusses the development of AEZS-108, its targeting mechanism, preclinical studies, and clinical trials in patients with endometrial, ovarian, prostatic, and bladder cancers. We emphasize its development as a personalized medicine approach. The studies reviewed demonstrate the effects of the cytotoxic LHRH analog, AEZS-108, mediated by LHRH receptors, in in vivo models of LHRH-receptor-positive human endometrial, ovarian, breast, prostatic, colorectal, pancreatic, and bladder cancers xenografted into nude mice. Intravenous administration of AEZS 108 inhibits the growth of LHRH-receptor-positive tumors better than equimolar doses of the cytotoxic agent doxorubicin and is far less toxic. AEZS 108 has no antitumor activity in cancers negative to LHRH receptor. This strongly supports the concept of targeting cytotoxic chemotherapy to tumor cells expressing LHRH receptors. Early clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of AEZS-108. A Phase I trial assessed the maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AEZS-108 given once every 3 weeks in patients with gynecological cancers. Two Phase II studies in heavily pretreated ovarian and recurrent endometrial cancers showed good clinical activity after a maximum of six courses of AEZS-108 as a single agent. Ongoing clinical studies with AEZS-108 in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer and patients with chemotherapy refractory bladder cancer had shown early signs of clinical efficacy. Side effects are moderate and easily manageable. In particular, no pituitary or cardiac toxicity is observed. Expert opinion: AEZS-108 is a cytotoxic analog designed for receptor-mediated targeted chemotherapy and consists of an LHRH carrier linked to doxorubicin. Preclinical studies demonstrate that the uptake of AEZS-108 is achieved by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Results of Phase I and II clinical trials in patients with gynecological cancers demonstrated anticancer activity without cardiotoxicity even in highly pretreated patients. Phase I/II studies in castration-resistant prostate cancer and chemotherapy refractory bladder cancer are in progress. Targeted chemotherapy with a cytotoxic analog of LHRH, such as AEZS-108, is therefore being considered for Phase III studies in advanced endometrial cancers positive for LHRH receptor. LHRH receptors are also present in human colon cancers, melanomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas, and treatment of these cancers with AEZS-108 should also be undertaken. Before such treatment with AEZS-108 is begun, the status of tumoral LHRH receptors of patients must be determined. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.","doxorubicin; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; gonadorelin derivative; gonadorelin receptor; gonadorelin[6 dextro lysine] 2 pyrrolinodoxorubicin; gonadorelin[6 dextro lysine] doxorubicin; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; thyrotropin; allergic reaction; alopecia; anemia; antineoplastic activity; bladder cancer; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; clinical trial (topic); colorectal cancer; confocal laser microscopy; diarrhea; drug cytotoxicity; drug dose reduction; drug effect; drug marketing; drug safety; drug targeting; drug tolerability; endocytosis; endometrium cancer; erythrocyte transfusion; febrile neutropenia; heart disease; hormone blood level; human; IC 50; in vivo study; leukopenia; maximum plasma concentration; mucosa inflammation; nausea; neoplasm; nonhuman; ovary cancer; pancreas cancer; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); prostate cancer; review; thrombocytopenia; tumor cell; unspecified side effect; vomiting; xenograft; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Clinical Trials as Topic; Doxorubicin; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Female; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Neoplasms; Receptors, LHRH",,Review,Scopus

Sweet's syndrome (also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) in two patients receiving azacitidine therapy is reported. Summary. The development of Sweet's syndrome in association with azacitidine use is rare (three published case reports since the drug's U.S. marketing approval in 2004), and the syndrome is not listed as a potential adverse reaction in the product packaging. In one of two cases of probable azacitidine-related Sweet's syndrome reported here, a 64-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) developed a severe erythematous and nodular rash with peeling on his arms, legs, and face after receiving the drug (75 mg/m2 subcutaneously daily) for three days; the second case involved a 67-year-old man with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who experienced a similar skin rash, as well as chills and an elevated body temperature, after five days of treatment with azacitidine. In both cases, the results of dermatologic or pathologic examination and skin biopsies were consistent with Sweet's syndrome. Perhaps the strongest evidence of a drug-induced etiology in these cases was the close temporal relationship between the initiation of azacitidine use and the development of Sweet's syndrome, with prompt symptom resolution after the discontinuation of azacitidine use and administration of appropriate corticosteroid therapy. Conclusion. Azacitidine was the apparent cause of Sweet's syndrome in a patient with MDS and another with CMML. Both responded well to corticosteroid therapy. After resolution of the reaction, decitabine was given to the first patient and azacitidine to the second, without complications. Copyright © 2012, American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

We review the current status in applying induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology for the cellular therapy, drug screening, and in-vitro modeling of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent findings iPSCs are generated from somatic cells by overexpressing four reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc). Like human embryonic stem cells, iPSCs have features of self-renewal and pluripotency, and allow in-vitro disease modeling, drug screening, and cell replacement therapy. Disease-specific iPSCs were derived from patients of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal muscular atrophy. Neurons differentiated from these iPSCs recapitulated the in-vivo phenotypes, providing platforms for drug screening. In the case of Parkinson's disease, iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons gave positive therapeutic effect on a rodent Parkinson's disease model as a proof of principle in using iPSCs as sources of cell replacement therapy. Beyond iPSC technology, much effort is being made to generate neurons directly from dermal fibroblasts with neuron-specific transcription factors, which does not require making iPSCs as an intermediate cell type. Summary We summarize recent progress in using iPSCs for modeling the progress and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and provide evidence for future perspectives in this field. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.","kruppel like factor 4; Myc protein; octamer transcription factor 4; presenilin 1; presenilin 2; transcription factor Sox2; Alzheimer disease; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; cell immortalization; cell renewal; disease model; dopaminergic nerve cell; drug cost; drug marketing; drug safety; drug screening; embryonic stem cell; human; Huntington chorea; in vitro study; in vivo study; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); phenotype; pluripotent stem cell; review; skin fibroblast; spinal muscular atrophy; stem cell transplantation; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Stem Cell Transplantation",,Review,Scopus

The furthest in development, the antagonist antiCTLA-4 antibodies, which block a key negative regulator of T-cell activation, have been shown to produce durable clinical responses in a small subset of patients. One of these antibodies, ipilimumab, also prolonged overall survival in two randomized phase III studies, leading to regulatory approval for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Consistent with its mechanism of action, the major adverse events from antiCTLA4 stem from immune-mediated inflammatory reactions. Paradigms for the administration of antiCTLA-4 and newer immunomodulatory agents have evolved to effectively manage the adverse events and also to consider unique patterns and kinetics of tumor response. Early clinical studies of another antagonist antibody, which blocks the co-inhibitory receptor PD-1 on activated T cells, also are showing promising activity in metastatic melanoma. The clinical efficacy of cancer vaccines, which in broad terms also includes intratumorally administered agents designed to increase tumor immunogenicity, is being investigated in ongoing phase III trials, and various new agents are in earlier development, including newer cytokines and T-cell or DC co-stimulatory antibodies, some of which have already demonstrated clinical activity in advanced disease. Current data suggest that focusing development on agents countering immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment or blocking regulatory checkpoints to T-cell activation may have the greatest clinical yield. Combinations of immunomodulatory agents also may improve clinical activity, although possibly at a cost of greater toxicity.

Cohort 1 of the selected 18 high-tier regulatory documents from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) regulatory frameworks were subject to a manual documentary analysis. These documents were consistent with the legal requirements for manufacturing and use of biologic drugs in humans and fall into six different categories. Manual analysis included a terminology search. The occurrence, frequency, and interchangeable use of different terms and phrases were recorded in the manual documentary analysis. Despite obvious differences, manual documentary analysis revealed certain consistency in use of terminology across analyzed frameworks. Phrase search frequencies have shown less uniformity than the search of terms. Overall, the EMA framework's documents referred to ""medicinal products"" and ""marketing authorization(s),"" the FDA documents discussed ""drug(s)"" or ""biologic(s),"" and the TGA documents referred to ""biological(s)."" Although high-tier documents often use different terminology they share concepts and themes.

Current technology is based on immortalized cell lines, rodent cells and primary human hepatocytes, all of which suffer from shortcomings. Cell lines and rodent cells have limited relevance to human physiology, while primary human cells remain a scarce and variable resource. These systems are inadequate, as evidenced by the high levels of compound attrition in the clinical trial and postmarketing stages of development, producing safety risks and high financial costs. Hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury account for a substantial proportion of compound failures, highlighting the need for accurate and predictive liver toxicity models. Pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells offer a means of creating physiologically relevant drug screening assays that could serve as an additional method of detecting toxicity in the lead optimization phase of drug development. The scalability and definition of pluripotent cell culture systems are constantly improving, bringing a potentially inexhaustible cell resource closer to industrial translation. Meanwhile, increased understanding of pluripotency, differentiation and reprogramming, combined with optimization of tissue culture environments, will allow the ongoing issues of hepatocyte lifespan and immature function to be addressed. In future, extensive validation of stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells against existing drug screening methods will be required if they are to be established as a standard tool for investigating drug toxicity. © 2012 Adis Data Information BV.

The nominee of the Distinguished Service Award Lecture gave an account of his career achievements particularly on the domain of chronically instrumented animals for assessing cardiovascular safety. The value of Safety Pharmacology resides in the benefits delivered to Pharma organizations, regulators, payers and patients. Meticulous due diligence concerning compliance of Safety Pharmacology studies to best practices is an effective means to ensure that equally stringent safety criteria are applied to both in-licensed and in-house compounds. Innovative technologies of great potential for Safety Pharmacology presented at the meeting are organs on chips (lung, heart, intestine) displaying mechanical and biochemical features of native organs, electrical field potential (MEA) or impedance (xCELLigence Cardio) measurements in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes for unveiling cardiac electrophysiological and mechanical liabilities, functional human airway epithelium (MucilAir™) preparations with unique 1-year shelf-life for acute and chronic in vitro evaluation of drug efficacy and toxicity. Custom-designed in silico and in vitro assay platforms defining the receptorome space occupied by chemical entities facilitate, throughout the drug discovery phase, the selection of candidates with optimized safety profile on organ function. These approaches can now be complemented by advanced computational analysis allowing the identification of compounds with receptorome, or clinically adverse effect profiles, similar to those of the drug candidate under scrutiny for extending the safety assessment to potential liability targets not captured by classical approaches. Nonclinical data supporting safety can be quite reassuring for drugs with a discovered signal of risk. However, for marketing authorization this information should be complemented by a clear clinical proof of safety. The ongoing outsourcing process of Regulatory Safety Pharmacology activities from large Pharmas to contract research organizations should be taken as an opportunity to establish long-overdue in-house Exploratory Safety Pharmacology units fully dedicated to the optimization of clinical candidates on organ safety. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.","aminoglycoside; angiotensin receptor antagonist; astemizole; bevacizumab; bosutinib; cadmium chloride; cephalosporin; cisapride; cyclosporin A; detomidine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dofetilide; gemcitabine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; imatinib; isoprenaline; mannitol; mercury chloride; mitomycin; penicillin G; rosiglitazone; sulfonamide; terfenadine; thiazide diuretic agent; thioridazine; trastuzumab; unindexed drug; verapamil; viper venom; xylazine; acute kidney tubule necrosis; allergic interstitial nephritis; cardiovascular system; cell immortalization; cell protection; clinical practice; computer model; conference paper; coronary artery blood flow; DNA methylation; Doppler flowmetry; drug development; drug efficacy; drug industry; drug marketing; drug safety; drug toxicity; electric potential; electroencephalography; ex vivo study; follow up; gene silencing; good laboratory practice; health care personnel; health care quality; health service; heart electrophysiology; heart failure; heart function; heart left ventricle pressure; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; interstitial nephritis; karyotype; kidney injury; lab on a chip; laboratory automation; medical society; nephritis; nephrotoxicity; nonhuman; osmotic nephritis; patient safety; pharmacodynamics; pharmacokinetics; pharmacology; plethysmography; pluripotent stem cell; Purkinje fiber; QRS complex; QT interval; QT prolongation; respiratory epithelium; RR interval; side effect; telemetry; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; urinalysis","Informa Healthcare",Conference Paper,Scopus

Long-term continuous treatment with lenalidomide beyond first response may be important to optimize responses and delay relapse. Areas covered: This review summarizes the lenalidomide mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, key clinical studies with a focus on safety and post-marketing surveillance data. The necessity for early adverse-event management, including dose modifications for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, where applicable, in order to maintain patients on treatment and achieve optimal efficacy, is discussed. Secondary primary malignancies in MM and progression to acute myeloid leukemia in MDS patients in the context of lenalidomide treatment are also discussed. Finally, as lenalidomide is renally excreted, the requirement for dose adjustment according to creatinine clearance is discussed. Expert opinion: Lenalidomide is highly effective and generally well tolerated. Most adverse events occur early during the course of treatment and are manageable. Lenalidomide is not associated with peripheral neuropathy and has a lack of cumulative toxicity, making it an effective treatment option for long-term use in the management of MM and low/intermediate-1-risk MDS, specifically with chromosome 5q deletion with or without other cytogenetic abnormalities. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.","acetylsalicylic acid; alkylating agent; antihistaminic agent; bortezomib; dexamethasone; imid; lenalidomide; low molecular weight heparin; melphalan; placebo; prednisone; revassist; steroid; thalidomide; unclassified drug; acute granulocytic leukemia; anemia; article; asthenia; bacterial infection; bleeding disorder; blood cell count; cancer chemotherapy; cancer growth; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer risk; cerebrovascular accident; chromosome 5q; chromosome deletion 5; clinical trial (topic); constipation; creatinine clearance; deep vein thrombosis; diarrhea; disease course; drug dose reduction; drug megadose; drug safety; drug withdrawal; fatigue; heart infarction; human; hyperglycemia; hypokalemia; hypothyroidism; kidney dysfunction; kidney failure; low drug dose; lung embolism; monotherapy; multiple cycle treatment; multiple myeloma; muscle cramp; mycosis; myelodysplastic syndrome; nausea; neurotoxicity; neutropenia; peripheral neuropathy; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); pneumonia; postmarketing surveillance; primary tumor; pruritus; randomized controlled trial (topic); rash; recurrent disease; second cancer; skin manifestation; stem cell transplantation; teratogenicity; thrombocytopenia; venous thromboembolism; virus infection; Administration, Oral; Antineoplastic Agents; Disease Progression; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Multiple Myeloma; Myelodysplastic Syndromes; Product Surveillance, Postmarketing; Renal Insufficiency; Thalidomide; Time Factors",,Article,Scopus

Trials for stem cell treatments are currently underway around the world; however, very few applications are widely available. In spite of this, a range of purported stem cell therapies are being marketed directly to patients, principally via the Internet. Scientists and clinicians have expressed concerns about the marketing of unproven treatments but responses thus far have been based upon a limited understanding of the dynamics of the advertising of such treatments. Drawing on the findings from a qualitative analysis of online, direct-to-consumer advertisements (DTCA) for stem cell treatments, this article examines the role played by such advertisements in the political economy of hope. It reveals the various techniques used by advertisers to effect a positive portrayal of treatments and thus help engender confidence in treatments and trust in providers. It concludes by discussing the implications of the findings for policy responses to the marketing of such treatments. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","advertizing; article; economic aspect; health care cost; health care policy; health care quality; human; Internet; medical tourism; priority journal; stem cell transplantation",,Article,Scopus

The primary mechanism of action of pazopanib can be described through its antiangiogenic properties via inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase of VEGF receptor (VEGFR) and PDGF receptor (PDGFR). It is an orally available angiogenesis inhibitor that targets VEGFR-1, -2 and -3, PDGFR-α and -β, and c-kit.

These results support targeted efforts to bank family cord blood units that can be used for a sibling diagnosed with a disease which can be cured by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or for research that investigates the use of allogeneic or autologous cord blood cells. Over 500 patients transplanted with related cord blood units have been reported to the Eurocord registry with a 4-year overall survival of 91% for patients with nonmalignant diseases and 56% for patients with malignant diseases. Main hematologic indications in children are leukemia, hemoglobinopathies or inherited hematologic, immunological or metabolic disorders. However, family-directed cord blood banking is not widely promoted; many cord blood units used in sibling transplantation have been obtained from private banks that do not meet the necessary criteria required to store these units. Marketing by private banks who predominantly store autologous cord blood units has created public confusion. There are very few current validated indications for autologous storage but some new indications might appear in the future. Little effort is devoted to provide unbiased information and to educate the public as to the distinction between the different types of banking, economic models and standards involved in such programs.

In Belgium, the Drug Reimbursement Committee (DRC) evaluates reimbursement requests for orphan drugs based on multiple criteria: the therapeutic value, price and proposed reimbursement tariff; the importance of the drug in clinical practice; and the budget impact of the drug. Objectives: This study aimed to assess reimbursement dossiers of orphan drugs in Belgium and to compare them with the clinical evidence submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Methods: A qualitative analysis examined all reimbursement dossiers of orphan drugs that were submitted in Belgium between January 2002 and June 2008. The following information was extracted from each dossier: description of the orphan drug; indication; reimbursement status; therapeutic value and needs; budget impact; and number of registered indications. For selected orphan drugs, an in-depth analysis extracted and compared information about the clinical trials, their primary endpoints and results from EMA documents (i.e. the marketing authorization application file, European public assessment report and summary of product characteristics) and the Belgian reimbursement dossiers. Results: Reimbursement was awarded to the majority of orphan drugs. In addition to the official criteria, other negotiable factors, such as price adjustments, employment incentives, patient population restrictions and funding of diagnostic tests by the company, seemed to play a role in the reimbursement decision. Despite the low number of patients, randomized controlled trials were conducted for many orphan drugs. Budget-impact analyses were simplistic and did not consider the impact across multiple indications. Some differences were also observed between the clinical evidence submitted to the EMA and that submitted to the Belgian DRC. Conclusions: In addition to the official criteria, other negotiable factors, such as price adjustments and employment incentives, may play a role in Belgian reimbursement decisions of orphan drugs. Some differences have also been noted between the clinical evidence reported in EMA documents and the evidence included in Belgian reimbursement dossiers of orphan drugs. There appears to be a need for further standardization of Belgian reimbursement applications and for European cooperation in sharing clinical evidence of orphan drugs. © 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

The first part of this review seeks to provide an understanding of the financial drivers and key elements of a successful business strategy that underpin a company focused on developing iPS-related products and services targeted at the research market. The latter part of the review highlights some of the reasons as to why the reprogramming of somatic cells is currently being used to develop cell-based models to screen for small molecules with drug-like properties rather than to develop cell-based regenerative medicines per se. The latter may be used to repair or replace a patient's damaged cells and thereby have the potential to 'cure' a disease and, in doing so, prevent or delay the onset of associated medical conditions. However, the cost of an expensive regenerative medicine and time to accrue any benefit linked to a decrease in co-morbidity expenditure may not outweigh the benefit for a healthcare community that has finite resources. The implications of this are discussed together with evidence that the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Health Service (NHS) have established a precedent for a cost-sharing strategy with the pharmaceutical industry. © 2011 The Royal Society.","cytology; drug; literature review; molecular analysis; morbidity; research work; economics; financial management; human; methodology; physiology; pluripotent stem cell; regenerative medicine; research; review; Humans; Marketing of Health Services; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Regenerative Medicine; Research; Ips",,Review,Scopus

Herewith the first EU-wide regulatory framework for ATMPs was established. It requires a central marketing authorisation application to the EMA (European Medicinal Agency). This new framework especially changes the code of regulatory practice for tissue engineered products (TEPs), as no registration procedure had been previously required for autologous TEPs. This also meant that no clinical proof of efficacy achieved by a pivotal clinical trial was necessary. Difficulties and their background as well as the vast requirements for product development that have to be addressed by small companies within a very short time frame are presented. Hereby, it is obvious that regulatory experience which is required to identify and implement the resulting implications was not in place yet and still had to be established. The lack of regulatory experience also resulted in difficulties with scientific advice preparation, expectations toward regulatory agencies, consultants, and transformation of regulatory requirements. Addressing the regulatory requirements within the transition period is even more difficult for entrepreneurs with products which are assigned for indications resulting in complex challenges to the trial design. Due to the enormous time pressure to generate data and due to the implied financial pressure, different adaptation strategies are evolving. In Germany the ""hospital exemption"" according to §4b AMG (German Medicinal Products Law) is of major importance. A reorientation toward acellular products and a slow down in development of new ATMP products is expected. © 2011 Springer Medizin Verlag.","biological product; article; biotechnology; cartilage cell; clinical trial (topic); Europe; experimental therapy; gene therapy; human; legal aspect; marketing; product safety; quality control; stem cell transplantation; tissue engineering; transplantation; Biological Agents; Biotechnology; Chondrocytes; Clinical Trials as Topic; Consumer Product Safety; Europe; Gene Therapy; Humans; Marketing; Quality Control; Stem Cell Transplantation; Therapies, Investigational; Tissue Engineering",,Article,Scopus

What made them unique was that contrary to classical chemotherapeutical drugs, they were manufactured by living cells. One of these biopharmaceuticals was granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Once their patent expired, generic versions appeared in pharmacies. They are now called biosimilars. There are several biosimilar G-CSFs approved in Europe: Biograstim/Filgrastim ratiopharm/Ratiograstim/Tevagrastim (XM02); Zarzio and Nivestim. All these new products are manufactured in facilities with state-of-the-art technology. All products have passed the regulatory requirements for approval, mainly Phase I and Phase III, with the consequent PD/PK evaluations and studies on efficacy and safety. However, there are still someconcerns regarding their long-term evaluation, in particular, the limited experience at the time of approval of these products in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. For this reason, pharmacovigilance should be rigorous. A lot of work remains to be done in terms of clarification with regard to substituting a biosimilar G-CSF for the innovator product and, finally, information must be provided to physicians, pharmacists and patients to allow for proper decision making. Ultimately, only clinical trials and effective post-marketing pharmacovigilance will provide definitive evidence that a biosimilar is comparable to the originator-reference product in terms of efficacy and safety. © 2011 Springer Verlag France.","granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor; hemopoietic growth factor; recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor; abdominal pain; alopecia; asthenia; bioequivalence; bone pain; breast cancer; cell differentiation; cell metabolism; cell proliferation; diarrhea; disease duration; drug activity; drug bioavailability; drug efficacy; drug half life; drug safety; drug surveillance program; endothelium cell; febrile neutropenia; fibroblast; granulocyte; granulopoiesis; hematology; human; idiopathic disease; idiopathic neutropenia; immunogenicity; limb pain; lung cancer; medical decision making; monocyte; multiple cycle treatment; neutropenia; neutrophil; neutrophil count; nonhodgkin lymphoma; oncology; peripheral blood stem cell; phagocytosis; pharmacist; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); physician; protein expression; protein renaturation; recombinant DNA technology; recurrent infection; review",,Review,Scopus

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the businesses and business practices of entities promoting medical tourism and the types and costs of procedures being offered. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, AND OUTCOMES: Between June and August 2008, we conducted a telephone survey of all businesses engaged in facilitating overseas medical travel for US residents. We collected information from each company including: the number of employees; number of patients referred overseas; medical records security processes; destinations to which patients were referred; treatments offered; treatment costs; and whether patient outcomes were collected. RESULTS: We identified 63 medical tourism companies and 45 completed our survey (71%). Companies had a meanof9.8 employees and had referred an average of 285 patients overseas (a total of approximately 13,500 patients). 35 (79%) companies reported requiring accreditation of foreign providers, 22 (50%) collected patient outcome data, but only 17 (39%) described formal medical records security policies. The most common destinations were India (23 companies, 55%), Costa Rica (14, 33%), and Thailand (12, 29%). The most common types of care included orthopedics (32 companies, 73%), cardiac care (23, 52%), and cosmetic surgery (29, 66%). 20 companies (44%) offered treatments not approved for useinthe US-most commonly stem cell therapy. Average costs for common procedures, CABG ($18,600) and knee arthroplasty ($10,800), were similar to previous reports. CONCLUSIONS: The number of Americans traveling overseas for medical care with assistance from medical tourism companies is relatively small. Attention to medical records security and patient outcomes is variable and cost-savings are dependent on US prices. That said, overseas medical care can be a reasonable alternative for price sensitive patients in need of relatively common, elective medical procedures. © 2010 Society of General Internal Medicine.","article; cardiovascular procedures; commercial phenomena; cost benefit analysis; esthetic surgery; health care cost; health care policy; health care quality; human; knee arthroplasty; medical practice; medical record; medical tourism; medicare; orthopedics; outcome assessment; patient referral; stem cell transplantation; telemedicine; United States; Data Collection; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Marketing; Medical Records; Medical Tourism; Quality of Health Care; Residence Characteristics; Surgical Procedures, Elective; Travel; United States",,Article,Scopus

In that context, the European Commission invited stakeholder bodies (industry, non-governmental organisations, EU Member States, and the Commission's Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety) to identify scientific experts in five toxicological areas, i.e. toxicokinetics, repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenicity, skin sensitisation, and reproductive toxicity for which the Directive foresees that the 2013 deadline could be further extended in case alternative and validated methods would not be available in time. The selected experts were asked to analyse the status and prospects of alternative methods and to provide a scientifically sound estimate of the time necessary to achieve full replacement of animal testing. In summary, the experts confirmed that it will take at least another 7-9 years for the replacement of the current in vivo animal tests used for the safety assessment of cosmetic ingredients for skin sensitisation. However, the experts were also of the opinion that alternative methods may be able to give hazard information, i.e. to differentiate between sensitisers and non-sensitisers, ahead of 2017. This would, however, not provide the complete picture of what is a safe exposure because the relative potency of a sensitiser would not be known. For toxicokinetics, the timeframe was 5-7 years to develop the models still lacking to predict lung absorption and renal/biliary excretion, and even longer to integrate the methods to fully replace the animal toxicokinetic models. For the systemic toxicological endpoints of repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity, the time horizon for full replacement could not be estimated. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","carcinogen; cosmetic; adverse outcome; animal testing alternative; animal testing replacement; bioassay; biological model; carcinogen testing; cell assay; cell culture monitoring; computer model; concentration (parameters); cosmetic industry; health hazard; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; kidney tubule excretion; local lymph node assay; marketing; metabolic regulation; nonhuman; practice guideline; prediction; priority journal; product safety; quantitative structure activity relation; reproductive toxicity; review; risk assessment; skin sensitization; standardization; stem cell; strategic planning; toxicity testing; toxicokinetics; Animal Testing Alternatives; Animals; Biological Availability; Carcinogenicity Tests; Consumer Product Safety; Cosmetics; European Union; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Skin; Toxicity Tests; Animalia",,Review,Scopus

This strategy involves exploration of drugs that have already been approved for treatment of other diseases and/or whose targets have already been discovered. Various techniques including data mining, bioinformatics, and usage of novel screening platforms have been used for identification and screening of potential repositioning candidates. However, challenges in clinical trials and intellectual property issues may be encountered during the repositioning process.

Since the late 1980s cord blood has been used in an expanding range of treatments and as an alternative to the use of bone marrow stem cells. This is particularly the case in treating ethnic minority populations who have historically been under-represented in bone marrow registries. The paper explores the mobilisation and commercialisation of an increasingly important bioeconomic resource with cord blood units trading internationally at high prices. This is a market mediated through a sophisticated global network of immunologically typed and matched bodily matter in which immunity has become a form of 'corporeal currency'. Based on recent international figures we reflect upon the balance of trade between imports and exports across the world's cord blood bioeconomy. Theoretically, this case is, we suggest, an extension of what Roberto Esposito (2008) has termed an 'immunitary paradigm' in which immunity has become the basis for new forms of bioeconomic flow, circulation and exchange.

The keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) palifermin has been approved as a new, targeted therapy for the prevention of severe oral mucositis. Areas covered: The authors review the literature on pharmacokintetics and clinical use of palifermin in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors for the prevention of chemo- and radiation-induced mucositis by using the PubMed database and additional literature where applicable. The article includes in vitro data, clinical trials as well as case reports regarding dosage, administration schedule, efficacy and adverse events. Expert opinion: There is sufficient data for a beneficial effect of palifermin prophylaxis for patients with hematological cancers receiving high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation as well as patients with head and neck cancer receiving combined irradiation and chemotherapy. In less mucotoxic regimens, dose and schedule of palifermin to achieve protection from mucositis are less well defined. The balance of benefit and unwanted effects has to be evaluated and weighed for individual chemotherapy regimens and patient groups. Further research on the prevention of mucositis should aim to determine the patient's individual risk to develop severe mucositis. © Informa UK, Ltd.","allopurinol; amifostine; amylase; anthracycline; antiinfective agent; antiinflammatory agent; antineoplastic agent; benzydamine; busulfan; calcineurin inhibitor; chlorhexidine; cyclophosphamide; cytarabine; fluorouracil; folinic acid; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; immunoglobulin; iodine; melphalan; methotrexate; palifermin; placebo; recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor; sucralfate; tetracaine; triacylglycerol lipase; acanthosis nigricans; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; allogeneic stem cell transplantation; alopecia; amylase blood level; arthralgia; article; autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; autologous stem cell transplantation; B cell leukemia; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; chemical carcinogenesis; colorectal cancer; cost control; cryotherapy; disease course; disease severity; drug blood level; drug clearance; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; drug elimination; drug eruption; drug fever; drug half life; drug marketing; drug mechanism; drug megadose; drug metabolism; drug overdose; drug receptor binding; drug safety; drug surveillance program; erythema; fertility; graft versus host reaction; hand foot syndrome; head and neck cancer; health care cost; hematologic malignancy; human; hyperesthesia; hypertension; hypesthesia; immunosuppressive treatment; mouth disease; multicenter study (topic); multiple cycle treatment; multiple myeloma; oral mucosa thickening; oral mucosal disease; paresthesia; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); pigment disorder; plasma concentration-time curve; pregnancy; pruritus; radiation dose; radiation induced mucositis; radiation injury; radiation protection; randomized controlled trial (topic); salivation; sarcoma; side effect; single drug dose; skin edema; skin hyperpigmention; skin papilloma; skin pigmentation; squamous cell carcinoma; stomatitis; taste disorder; tongue disease; triacylglycerol lipase blood level; virus infection; virus reactivation; Wart virus; whole body radiation; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Clinical Trials as Topic; Combined Modality Therapy; Drug Evaluation; Fibroblast Growth Factor 7; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; Stomatitis; Whole-Body Irradiation",,Article,Scopus

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed in six maternities. This anonymous and self-completed questionnaire included 29 multiple-choice questions based on: 1) sociodemographic factors, 2) awareness and access to information about cord blood banking, 3) banking option preferences, and 4) donating cord blood units (CBUs) to research. RESULTS: A total of 79% of pregnant women had little awareness of cord blood banking (n = 1620). A total of 58% of women had heard of the therapeutic benefits of cord blood, of which 21% received information from midwives and obstetricians. A total of 89% of respondents would opt to store CBUs. Among them, 76% would choose to donate CBUs to a public bank to benefit any patient in need of a cord blood transplant. Twelve percent would choose a mixed bank, and 12%, a private bank. A total of 92% would donate their child's CBU to research when it is not suitable for transplantation. CONCLUSION: The study reveals a strong preference for public banking in all five countries, based on converging values such as solidarity. Attitudes of pregnant women are not an obstacle to the rapid expansion of allogeneic banking in these EU countries. Banking choices do not appear to be correlated with household income. The extent of commercial marketing of cord blood banks in mass media highlights the importance for obstetric providers to play a central role in raising women's awareness early during their pregnancy with evidence-based medical information about banking options.","access to information; adult; article; attitude; blood bank; blood donor; blood storage; cord blood stem cell; demography; female; France; Germany; human; Italy; medical information; obstetric patient; pregnant woman; questionnaire; Spain; stem cell; umbilical cord blood; United Kingdom; Adult; Biomedical Research; Blood Banks; Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation; Europe; Female; Fetal Blood; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Income; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women",,Article,Scopus

Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation regulates many key processes including cell growth and survival. However, dysregulation of RTK has been found in a wide range of cancers, and it has been shown to correlate with the development and progression of numerous cancers. Therefore, RTK has become an attractive therapeutic target. One way to effectively block signaling from RTK is inhibition of its catalytic activity with small-molecule inhibitors. Low-molecular-weight TK inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib, targeting tumors with mutant c-Kit, and gefitinib, targeting non-small cell lung cancer with mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), have received marketing approval in Japan. MET, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) are frequently genetically altered in advanced cancers. TKIs of these receptors have not yet appeared on the market, but many anticancer drug candidates are currently undergoing clinical trials. Most of these TKIs were designed to compete with ATP at the ATP-binding site within the TK domain. This review will focus on small-molecule TKIs targeting MET, FGFR, and IGF-IR and discuss the merits and demerits of two types of agents, i.e., those with only one or a few targets and those directed at multiple targets. Targeting agents specifically inhibiting the target kinase were previously searched for based on the hypothesis that a narrow target window might reduce unexpected side effects, but agents with multiple targets have been recently developed to overcome tumors resistant against a single-targeting agent. © 2011 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.","1 tert butyl 3 [6 (3,5 dimethoxyphenyl) 2 (4 diethylaminobutylamino)pyrido[2,3 d]pyrimidin 7 yl]urea; 5 (2,6 dichlorobenzylsulfonyl) 3 [3,5 dimethyl 4 [2 (1 pyrrolidinylmethyl) 1 pyrrolidinylcarbonyl] 1h pyrrol 2 ylmethylene] 1,3 dihydro 2h indol 2 one; adenosine triphosphate; bevacizumab; brivanib; brivanib alaninate; cetuximab; crizotinib; dasatinib; epidermal growth factor receptor; erlotinib; fibroblast growth factor receptor; gefitinib; gemcitabine; imatinib; lapatinib; n (3 chlorophenyl) 3 [3,5 dimethyl 4 (4 methyl 1 piperazinylcarbonyl) 1h pyrrol 2 ylmethylene] 2,3 dihydro n methyl 2 oxo 1h indole 5 sulfonamide; nilotinib; nvp aew 541; panitumumab; protein tyrosine kinase; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; scatter factor receptor; somatomedin C receptor; sorafenib; stem cell factor receptor; sunitinib; tivantinib; trastuzumab; unindexed drug; binding site; breast cancer; catalysis; cell growth; cell survival; chronic myeloid leukemia; colorectal cancer; colorectal carcinoma; drug bioavailability; drug targeting; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; gastrointestinal stromal tumor; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; kidney carcinoma; liver cell carcinoma; lung non small cell cancer; nonhuman; regulatory mechanism; review; stomach carcinoma","Pharmaceutical Society of Japan",Review,Scopus

Some of the molecular actors that regulate HSPC mobilization have been unravelled. In addition, some of the inter-individual variability of this phenomenon can be ascribed to clinical as well as to biological parameters.

This is particularly true for costly orphan drugs because access depends primarily on co-payments, reimbursement policies and prices. The objective of this article is to identify differences in the availability of orphan drugs and in patient access to them in 11 pharmaceutical markets: Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland and the US. Methods: Four rare diseases were selected for analysis: pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), Fabry disease (FD), hereditary angioedema (HAE) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Indicators for availability were defined as (i) the indications for which orphan drugs had been authorized in the treatment of these diseases; (ii) the application date; and (iii) the date upon which these drugs received market authorization in each country. Indicators of patient access were defined as (i) the outcomes of technology appraisals; (ii) the extent of coverage provided by healthcare payers; and (iii) the price of the drugs in each country. For PAH we analysed bosentan, iloprost, sildenafil, treprostinil (intravenous and inhaled) as well as sitaxentan and ambrisentan; for FD we analysed agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta; for HAE we analysed icatibant, ecallantide and two complement C1s inhibitors; for CML we analysed imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. Results: Most drugs included in this study had received market authorization in all countries, but the range of indications for which they had been authorized differed by country. The broadest range of indications was found in Australia, and the largest variations in indications were found for PAH drugs. Authorization process speed (the time between application and market authorization) was fastest in the US, with an average of 362 days, followed by the EU (394 days). The highest prices for the included drugs were found in Germany and the US, and the lowest in Canada, Australia and England. Although the prices of all of the included drugs were high compared with those of most non-orphan drugs, most of the insurance plans in our country sample provided coverage for authorized drugs after a certain threshold. Conclusions: Availability of and access to orphan drugs play a key role in determining whether patients will receive adequate and efficient treatment. Although the present study showed some variations between countries in selected indicators of availability and access to orphan drugs, virtually all of the drugs in question were available and accessible in our sample. However, substantial co-payments in the US and Canada represent important barriers to patient access, especially in the case of expensive treatments such as those analysed in this study. Market exclusivity is a strong instrument for fostering orphan drug development and drug availability. However, despite the positive effect of this instrument, the conditions under which market exclusivity is granted should be reconsidered in cases where the costs of developing an orphan drug have already been amortized through the use of the drug's active ingredient for the treatment of a common indication. © 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

In patients undergoing chemotherapy, mortality rates ranging from 50 to 90% have been associated with documented invasive fungal infection. Voriconazole is a second-generation triazole, which is a synthesized derivative of fluconazole. It was first approved for marketing in the USA in 2002. Voriconazole has excellent bioavailability and is available in oral and intravenous dosage form. It has extended-spectrum antifungal activity whereby it is highly effective against a variety of fungal organisms, including Candida, Fusarium, Paecilomyces and Scedosporium species, but it is especially known for its activity against the Aspergillu s species. Voriconazole has become widely used for three types of treatment strategies (i.e., targeted, empirical and prophylactic). However, voriconazole is a high-cost antifungal agent and, therefore, its effectiveness should be scrutinized, taking into consideration its cost in relation to the costs of other comparable antifungal agents. This article summarizes the 18 identified peer-reviewed publications on the pharmacoeconomics of voriconazole in the English literature, up to March 2010, and provides a view on its future role in therapy. Comparisons with existing antifungals are provided when possible to illustrate the potential role of voriconazole in a clinical setting. The studies took place in a variety of countries and were all retrospective in nature, with the majority suggesting that voriconazole is a more cost-effective option for antifungal treatment.

However, in the broader biopharmaceutical sector, the EU is outperformed by the USA on all metrics, reflecting longstanding problems: limited venture capital finance, a fragmented patent system, and relatively weak relations between academia and industry. The current global downturn has exacerbated these difficulties. The crisis comes at a time when the EU is reframing its approach to the governance of innovation and renewing its commitment to the goal of making Europe the leading player in the global knowledge economy. If the EU is to gain a competitive advantage in the regenerative medicine sector then it must coordinate a complex multilevel governance framework that encompasses the EU, member states and regional authorities. This article takes stock of Europes current competitive position within the global bioeconomy, drawing on a variety of metrics in the three intersecting spheres of innovation governance: science, market and society. These data then provide a platform for reviewing the problems of innovation governance faced by the EU and the strategic choices that have to be confronted in the regenerative medicine sector. © 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.","biotechnology; capital; economic aspect; economic evaluation; Europe; funding; government regulation; health care cost; health care manpower; health care policy; human; income; industrial production; investment; marketing; medical research; patent; priority journal; product development; regenerative medicine; reimbursement; research ethics; resource management; review; stem cell transplantation; training; Biotechnology; Capital Financing; Drug Industry; Europe; Internationality; Japan; Organizational Innovation; Patents as Topic; Regenerative Medicine; Research Support as Topic; United States",,Review,Scopus

These regional differences have provided a basis for scientific and clinical assessment of these apheresis technologies and their clinical outcomes, and have impacted the marketing and business developments of new technologies worldwide. The results of the International Apheresis Registry for 2007 report data from 20 centers on five continents. The survey collected data exclusively via a secure internet website on 1735 patients for a total of 6787 treatments. As with our prior registry for 2005, information on stem cell infusions was gathered. Information collected included patients demographics, medical history, treatment diagnoses, treatment specifics (type, methodology, access type, anticoagulants, drugs, and equipment usage), side effects, clinical response, and payment provider. As in prior International Apheresis Registries for 1983, 2000, 2002, and 2005, the survey results highlight the regional differences in apheresis usage and treatment methodologies indicating that an international overview of apheresis may be more representative of the impact of this therapeutic modality. © 2009 International Society for Apheresis.","adverse outcome; apheresis; article; clinical assessment; clinical practice; cytapheresis; demography; geographic distribution; health survey; hemoperfusion; human; Internet; lymphoplasmapheresis; marketing; medical information; outcome assessment; plasmapheresis; priority journal; register; stem cell transplantation; sustainable development; treatment indication; treatment response; Adult; Blood Component Removal; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Questionnaires; Registries; World Health",,Article,Scopus

Skeptics raise concerns about quality of care and patient safety, information disclosure to patients, legal redress when patients are harmed while receiving care at international hospitals, and harms to public health care systems in destination nations.

The drug development is a multistep complex process. It comprises of two phases: preclinical and clinical. Guidelines on preclinical testing of cell based immunotherapy medicinal products have been defined by regulatory agencies and are available. However, clinical testing of therapeutic cancer vaccines is still under debate. It presents a serious problem since recently clinical efficacy of the number of cancer vaccines has been demonstrated that focused a lot of public attention. In general clinical testing in the current form is very expensive, time consuming and poorly designed what may lead to overlooking of products clinically beneficial for patients. Accordingly regulatory authorities and researches including Cancer Vaccine Clinical Trial Working Group proposed three regulatory solutions to facilitate clinical development of cancer vaccines: cost-recovery program, conditional marketing authorization, and a new development paradigm. Paradigm includes a model in which cancer vaccines are investigated in two types of clinical trials: proof-of-principle and efficacy. The proof-of-principle trial objectives are: safety; dose selection and schedule of vaccination; and demonstration of proof-of-principle. Efficacy trials are randomized clinical trials with objectives of demonstrating clinical benefit either directly or through a surrogate.

However, several oncology drugs have been approved on the basis of objective end points without a randomized trial. We reviewed the long-term safety and efficacy of such agents. Methods: We searched the Web site of the US Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and MEDLINE for initial applications of investigational anticancer drugs from 1973 through 2006. Results: Overall, 68 oncology drugs, excluding hormone therapy and supportive care, were approved, including 31 without a randomized trial. For these 31 drugs, a median of two clinical trials (range, one to seven) and 79 patients (range, 40 to 413) were used per approval. Objective response was the most common end point used for approval; median response rate was 33% (range, 11% to 90%). Thirty drugs are still fully approved. United States marketing authorization for one drug, gefitinib (an epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] inhibitor), was rescinded after a randomized trial showed no survival improvement; however, this trial was performed in unselected patients, and it was subsequently demonstrated that patients with EGFR mutation are more likely to respond. Nineteen of the 31 drugs have additional uses (per National Comprehensive Cancer Network or National Cancer Institute Physician Data Query guidelines), and subsequent formal US Food and Drug Administration approvals were obtained for 11 of these (range, one to 18 new indications). No drug has demonstrated safety concerns. Conclusion: Nonrandomized clinical trials with definitive end points can yield US Food and Drug Administration approvals, and these drugs have a reassuring record of long-term safety and efficacy. © 2009 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.","alpha interferon; alpha2b interferon; altretamine; antineoplastic agent; arsenic trioxide; asparaginase; asparaginase macrogol; bexarotene; bleomycin; bortezomib; busulfan; cisplatin; cladribine; cytotoxic agent; doxorubicin; etoposide; fludarabine; gefitinib; gemtuzumab ozogamicin; ifosfamide; irinotecan; methoxsalen; mitomycin; pentostatin; recombinant interleukin 2; retinoic acid; rituximab; temozolomide; tositumomab; unindexed drug; antineoplastic agent; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute lymphocytic leukemia; acute myeloblastic leukemia; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; B cell leukemia; cancer registry; cancer therapy; chronic lymphatic leukemia; chronic myeloid leukemia; colon cancer; cutaneous T cell lymphoma; disease free survival; drug approval; drug capsule; drug classification; drug efficacy; drug indication; drug safety; erythrocyte transfusion; follicular lymphoma; food and drug administration; germ cell testicular cancer; glioblastoma; hairy cell leukemia; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; human; information retrieval; Kaposi sarcoma; kidney carcinoma; lung non small cell cancer; MEDLINE; mutation; myeloma; nonhodgkin lymphoma; outcome assessment; ovary cancer; pancreas cancer; practice guideline; priority journal; promyelocytic leukemia; randomized controlled trial; rectum cancer; review; stomach cancer; testis cancer; treatment response; drug approval; methodology; United States; Antineoplastic Agents; Drug Approval; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration",,Review,Scopus

For those advanced therapies designated as medicinal products (such as gene therapies and DNA vaccines), the principles of good manufacturing practice (GMP) apply, and these are inspected by the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA). For those human cell- and tissue-derived therapies which are not classified as medicinal products, similar standards apply but the inspecting authority is the Human Tissue Authority (HTA).

This review re-examines our previous conclusions based on data published between 2003 and 2008. We again used the standard Prescrire methodology to review the latest data. • In patients who are symptomatic but who do not qualify for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (especially people aged over 65), the results of five comparative trials suggest that adding thalidomide to the melphalanprednisone combination delays myeloma progression by an additional 5 to 10 months. There is probably also an increase in overall survival time. This triple combination is therefore a first-line treatment option. There is no firm evidence that replacing thalidomide with bortezomib in this combination provides an advantage. • In symptomatic patients aged under 65, two meta-analyses have compared high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation with conventional chemotherapy. Unlike early trials, these meta-analyses showed no overall survival benefit but only a delay in myeloma progression. Initial treatment with two successive transplantation procedures has a negative risk-benefit balance. • The optimal chemotherapy regimen prior to autologous stem cell transplantation is controversial. It is unclear which combination (vincristine + doxorubicin + dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone, or bortezomib + dexamethasone, etc.) has a better risk-benefit balance in terms of survival and quality of life. • According to a meta-analysis of three clinical trials, thalidomide maintenance therapy appears to improve overall survival after autologous stem cell transplantation. • Despite their inadequate evaluation, lenalidomide and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin are licensed for use in patients who relapse or who are refractory to initial treatment. In view of their major adverse effects, we consider that these drugs should only be used in clinical trials.","alkylating agent; anticoagulant agent; antineoplastic agent; bortezomib; cyclophosphamide; dexamethasone; doxorubicin; lenalidomide; melphalan; placebo; prednisolone; prednisone; recombinant erythropoietin; thalidomide; vincristine; add on therapy; adjuvant therapy; allograft; autologous stem cell transplantation; bradycardia; clinical evaluation; clinical trial; drug efficacy; drug eruption; drug induced headache; drug megadose; drug safety; drug substitution; gastrointestinal disease; heart arrhythmia; hematologic disease; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; infection; lung embolism; meta analysis; methodology; multiple myeloma; neuropathy; overall survival; peripheral neuropathy; quality of life; relapse; review; risk; skin disease; survival rate; symptom; systematic review; treatment duration; treatment failure; treatment outcome; treatment response; tumor growth; vein thrombosis; Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Boronic Acids; Dexamethasone; Disease Progression; Doxorubicin; Humans; Melphalan; Multiple Myeloma; Prednisone; Pyrazines; Stem Cell Transplantation; Thalidomide; Transplantation, Autologous; Treatment Outcome; Vincristine",,Review,Scopus

The following descriptions of NMEs approved in 2008-2009 (TABLE) detail the clinical and pharmacologic profile of each new drug and provide a summary of selected pharmacokinetic, adverse-reaction, drug-interaction, and dosing data. This review is intended to be objective rather than evaluative in content. The information for each NME was obtained primarily from sources published prior to FDA approval. Experience clearly demonstrates that many aspects of a new drug's therapeutic profile are not detected in premarketing studies and emerge after the drug is used in large numbers of patients. For example, ""new"" adverse reactions are detected for many NMEs within 2 to 3 years of becoming available. Some of these drugs may eventually acquire at least one black box warning for serious adverse reactions or even be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons not recognized at the time of approval. Hence, while this review offers a starting point for learning about new drugs, it is essential that practitioners be vigilant about changes in a drug's therapeutic profile as reported by their own patients and in the pharmaceutical literature.

Broadly, the act accepted brain death as a form of death and made the sale of organs a punishable offence. With the acceptance of brain death, it became possible to not only undertake kidney transplantations but also start other solid organ transplants like liver, heart, lungs, and pancreas. Despite the THO legislation, organ commerce and kidney scandals are regularly reported in the Indian media. In most instances, the implementation of the law has been flawed and more often than once its provisions have been abused. Parallel to the living related and unrelated donation program, the deceased donation program has slowly evolved in a few states. In approximately one-third of all liver transplants, the organs have come from the deceased donor program as have all the hearts and pancreas transplants. In these states, a few hospitals along with committed NGOs have kept the momentum of the deceased donor program. The MOHAN Foundation (NGO based in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh) has facilitated 400 of the 1,300 deceased organ transplants performed in the country over the last 14 years. To overcome organ shortage, developed countries are re-looking at the ethics of unrelated programs and there seems to be a move towards making this an acceptable legal alternative. The supply of deceased donors in these countries has peaked and there has been no further increase over the last few years. India is currently having a deceased donation rate of 0.05 to 0.08 per million population. We need to find a solution on how we can utilize the potentially large pool of trauma-related brain deaths for organ donation. This year in the state of Tamil Nadu, the Government has passed seven special orders. These orders are expected to streamline the activity of deceased donors and help increase their numbers. Recently, on July 30, 2008, the Government brought in a few new amendments as a Gazette with the purpose of putting a stop to organ commerce. The ethics of commerce in organ donation and transplant tourism has been widely criticized by international bodies. The legal and ethical principles that we follow universally with organ donation and transplantation are also important for the future as these may be used to resolve our conflicts related to emerging sciences such as cloning, tissue engineering, and stem cells.","brain death; brain injury; cadaver donor; compensation; conference paper; donor selection; family; genetic analysis; health hazard; health status; heart graft; hospital management; human; India; informed consent; kidney transplantation; laboratory test; law; liver graft; living donor; lung transplantation; marketing; marriage; medical ethics; medicolegal aspect; motivation; nephrectomy; organ donor; organ transplantation; pancreas transplantation; patient safety; physician; practice guideline; public hospital; witness",,Conference Paper,Scopus

In 2006, Chung pioneered the first entire organ transplant using adult stem cells and a scaffold for clinical evaluation. With this a new milestone was achieved, with seven patients with myelomeningocele receiving stem cell-derived bladder transplants resulting in substantial improvements in their quality of life. While a bladder is a relatively simple organ, the breakthrough highlights the incredible benefits that can be gained from the cross-disciplinary nature of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) that encompasses stem cell research and stem cell bioprocessing. Unquestionably, the development of bioprocess technologies for the transfer of the current laboratory-based practice of stem cell tissue culture to the clinic as therapeutics necessitates the application of engineering principles and practices to achieve control, reproducibility, automation, validation and safety of the process and the product. The successful translation will require contributions from fundamental research (from developmental biology to the 'omics' technologies and advances in immunology) and from existing industrial practice (biologics), especially on automation, quality assurance and regulation. The timely development, integration and execution of various components will be critical - failures of the past (such as in the commercialization of skin equivalents) on marketing, pricing, production and advertising should not be repeated.

It is marketed for the treatment of children and adults with one or the other of these two malignant haemopathies, after failure of at least two lines of chemotherapy. • Clinical evaluation of nelarabine in this setting includes two non-comparative trials in accordance with the conditions of the marketing terms, one in 48 children and the other in 28 adults. A complete haematological response was observed in about 20% to 25% of patients overall. But this type of non-comparative trial cannot demonstrate whether a specific drug inereases survival time compared with existing alternatives. • In addition to haematological and gestrointestinal disorders, the main adverse effects of nelarabine were neurological (headache, drowsiness, peripheral neuropathies). Some adverse effects were serious, and they did not all resolve after treatment cessation.

Production of neutrophils depends on myeloid growth factors, particularly granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). After the original phase of development, researchers modified these growth factors to increase their size and delay renal clearance, increase their biologic potency, and create unique molecules for business purposes. Pegylated G-CSF is a successful product of these efforts. Researchers have also tried to identify small molecules to serve as oral agents that mimic the parent molecules, but these programs have been less successful. In 2006, the European Medicines Agency established guidelines for the introduction of new biologic medicinal products claimed to be similar to reference products that had previously been granted marketing authorization in the European community, called bio-similars. Globally, new and copied versions of G-CSF and other myeloid growth factors are now appearing. Some properties of the myeloid growth factors are similar to other agents, offering opportunities for the development of alternative drugs and treatments. For example, recent research shows that hematopoietic progenitor cells can be mobilized with a chemokine receptor antagonist, chemotherapy, G-CSF, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Advances in neutrophil biology coupled with better understanding and development of myeloid growth factors offer great promise for improving the care of patients with cancer and many other disorders. © Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.","antineoplastic agent; biological product; granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; hydroxypropylmethylcellulose; macrogol; myeloid growth factor; plerixafor; poloxamer; recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor; stem cell factor; unclassified drug; adjuvant therapy; article; biological activity; chemical modification; clinical trial; drug approval; drug design; drug efficacy; drug elimination; drug formulation; drug half life; drug legislation; drug manufacture; drug mechanism; drug safety; drug synthesis; drug treatment failure; human; leukocyte function; malignant neoplastic disease; neutropenia; neutrophil; neutrophil chemotaxis; nonhuman; stem cell mobilization; stem cell transplantation","Jones and Bartlett Publishers",Article,Scopus

In an ongoing ethical debate opinions of different groups are based on varying sets of religious, historical, cultural and scientific arguments as well as on widely differing levels of general information. We here give an overview of the biological background for non-specialists, and address all issues of the current stem cell debate that are of concern in different cultures and states. Thirty-five chapters address embryo definition, potential killing and the beginning of human life, in addition to matters of human dignity, patenting, commercialisation, and potential alternatives for the future, such as induced pluripotent (reprogrammed) stem cells. All arguments are compiled in a synopsis, and compromise solutions, e.g. for the definition of the beginning of personhood and for assigning dignity to embryos, are suggested. Until recently, the major application of hESC was thought to be transplantation of cells derived from hESC for therapeutic use. We discuss here that the most likely immediate uses will rather be in vitro test systems and disease models. Major and minor pharmaceutical companies have entered this field, and the European Union is sponsoring academic research into hESC-based innovative test systems. This development is supported by new testing strategies in Europe and the USA focussing on human cell-based in vitro systems for safety evaluations, and shifting the focus of toxicology away from classical animal experiments towards a more mechanistic understanding.","animal testing alternative; bioethics; cell therapy; conflict; cultural factor; embryonic stem cell; European Union; human; human dignity; marketing; patent; personhood; policy; review; animal; animal welfare; article; cell line; drug effect; embryo research; ethics; methodology; stem cell transplantation; Animal Testing Alternatives; Animal Welfare; Animals; Cell Line; Embryo Research; Embryonic Stem Cells; Humans; Stem Cell Transplantation",,Review,Scopus

This mAb is active in previously treated patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) refractory to alkylating agents and purine nucleoside analogs. Alemtuzumab is also investigated in previously untreated patients with this leukemia. The results of a prospective randomized Phase III study (CAM307 trial) comparing chlorambucil with alemtuzumab in the first-line treatment of progressive B-CLL were recently published. The overall response rate, complete remission rate, and progression-free survival were all superior for alemtuzumab. Moreover, elimination of minimal residual disease occurred in one third of complete responders to alemtuzumab and none to chlorambucil. Adverse events were similar in both arms with the exception of infusion-related reactions and cytomegalovirus infections. In 2001, alemtuzumab was approved in the USA and Europe as a third-line therapy for patients with B-CLL who had been treated with alkylating agents and failed fludarabine therapy. In September 2007, the US FDA, on the basis of CAM307 results, approved alemtuzumab for the treatment of previously untreated patients with B-CLL. Moreover, the European Commission recently granted marketing authorization to alemtuzumab for the treatment of patients with B-CLL for whom fludarabine combination monotherapy is not appropriate. © 2008 Expert Reviews Ltd.","aciclovir; alemtuzumab; apolizumab; carmustine; CD20 antigen; CD52 antigen; chlorambucil; chlorpheniramine; cladribine; cotrimoxazole; cyclophosphamide; cytarabine; dapsone; denileukin diftitox; diphenhydramine; epratuzumab; etoposide; fludarabine; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hydrocortisone; immunotoxin LMB2; lumiliximab; melphalan; ofatumumab; paracetamol; pentamidine; pentostatin; protein p53; rituximab; unindexed drug; alemtuzumab; antineoplastic agent; cancer antibody; monoclonal antibody; antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity; antigen expression; antigen recognition; apoptosis; area under the curve; article; autoimmune hemolytic anemia; B cell leukemia; bacterial pneumonia; cancer regression; chromosome 11q; chromosome 17p; chromosome deletion; chronic lymphatic leukemia; clinical trial; combination chemotherapy; complement dependent cytotoxicity; continuous infusion; cytogenetics; Cytomegalovirus; cytomegalovirus infection; disease free survival; drug approval; drug blood level; drug dosage form comparison; drug dose comparison; drug dose escalation; drug efficacy; drug elimination; drug fatality; drug half life; drug marketing; drug megadose; drug safety; drug treatment failure; drug withdrawal; dyspnea; Europe; fever; flu like syndrome; food and drug administration; gene mutation; graft failure; graft versus host reaction; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; hemorrhagic cystitis; human; hypotension; low drug dose; lymphoid cell; lymphoproliferative disease; minimal residual disease; monotherapy; multiple cycle treatment; nausea and vomiting; neutropenia; nonhuman; overall survival; patient selection; Pneumocystis carinii; prognosis; pure red cell anemia; rash; reduced intensity conditioning; rigor; thrombocytopenia; treatment outcome; tuberculosis; United States; urticaria; virus meningitis; B cell leukemia; hemolytic anemia; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; minimal residual disease; neutropenia; pure red cell anemia; review; Anemia, Hemolytic; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Neoplasm; Antineoplastic Agents; Humans; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell; Neoplasm, Residual; Neutropenia; Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic; Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure",,Article,Scopus

The interaction between physicians and patients is to provide health care services without the profit orientation. In modernized economy and in today's world of business, the relationship between doctors and patients has been dramatically changed. This transformation is very obvious in the private sector. Health care providers sell their services. Patients have been approached as customers. Decisions to make an investment on new medical technologies or new services would accompany with careful consideration on cost-benefit ratio, on marketing and also on short and long term return of the investment. However, most of the medical services available in the past were focusing on the ""real"" and ""tangible"" products. This means that the patients or the customers would obtain diagnosis, treatment, palliation or prevention for the fees they paid. They can at least obtain and can feel some direct or indirect health benefits from the services. With the advancement of science and technology, there is recently a new model of business that sells only the hope for future use. Private cord blood stem cell banking is a good example for this business model. Actually, business on hope is not the brand new business model. Insurance is a well-known classical prototype of business on hope. However, when this kind of business model is applied for medical services, there should be some precautions and also intervention including an oversight system from the government sector to make sure that all the information delivered to the clients and family is accurate and unbiased. From the public policy perspective, this business of hope should be appropriately regulated to preserve consumer rights while promoting the advancement of science and technology through sustainable business development.","cord blood stem cell transplantation; cost benefit analysis; decision making; health care personnel; human; medical ethics; medical service; public health; short survey; Commerce; Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Private Sector; Tissue Banks",,Short Survey,Scopus

Good news were marketing of ropinirole, a new non-ergot agonist, in December 2006 and entacapone, the first catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor in Japan in April 2007.

What is required is a biocompatible material for culture of cells in three-dimensions (3-D) that offers ease of use, experimental flexibility to alter composition and compliance, and a composition that would permit a seamless transition from in vitro to in vivo use. The challenge is to replicate the complexity of the native extracellular matrix (ECM) environment with the minimum number of components necessary to allow cells to rebuild a given tissue. Our approach is to deconstruct the ECM to a few modular components that can be reassembled into biomimetic materials that meet these criteria. These semi-synthetic ECMs (sECMs) employ thiol-modified derivatives of hyaluronic acid (HA) that can form covalently crosslinked, biodegradable hydrogels. These sECMs are ""living"" biopolymers, meaning that they can be crosslinked in the presence of cells or tissues to enable cell therapy and tissue engineering. Moreover, the sECMs allow inclusion of the appropriate biological cues needed to simulate the complexity of the ECM of a given tissue. Taken together, the sECM technology offers a manufacturable, highly reproducible, flexible, FDA-approvable, and affordable vehicle for cell expansion and differentiation in 3-D. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.","biomimetic material; hyaluronic acid derivative; bioengineering; cell differentiation; cell expansion; cell therapy; cross linking; extracellular matrix; hydrogel; nonhuman; reproducibility; review; tissue engineering","Landes Bioscience",Review,Scopus

A post-marketing, retrospective, parallel, comparative, multicenter survey study in transplant patients receiving these two formulations after transplantation was carried out in order to compare the toxicity profile and bioavailability. Materials and methods: The study was conducted in the five main leading transplantation centers in Israel and included 174 patients. A total of 1-3 CyA serum levels at different periods after transplantation were measured in each subject and the bioavailability, efficacy and toxicity profile were assessed. The blood concentrations were compared using a statistical model after adjustment for type of transplantation, dose and time after transplantation as confounding factors. Results: No distinct differences were observed between the two CyA formulations. Using model-derived least squares means (LSM) of the CyA blood levels and adjusting for relevant confounding factors, no significant difference could be found between the blood levels of the test and reference formulations. Most of the side effects were mild and transient with both formulations, whereas 23% of the patients reported serious adverse events (mainly hypertension, 15%). 20% of the patients developed infectious complications during the therapy.

The primary objective of the roadmap is to be a policy and technology planning tool helping to deal with an increasingly competitive environment. The obvious benefit of roadmapping is to provide information to make better technology investment decisions by identifying critical technologies and technology gaps and identifying methods to improve research and development (R&D) investments. It can also be used as a marketing tool. Roadmapping is critical and necessary when the technology investment decision is not straight forward. This occurs when it is not clear which alternative to pursue, how soon the technology is needed, or when there is a need to coordinate the development of multiple technologies. Stem cell technology is still in its nascent stage and one of the technologies with obvious uncertainties. Moreover, it involves many issues from bioethical, legal and public policy perspectives. Then, development of national policy and technology roadmap for stem cell technology is definitely required and crucial to make most benefit from this promising technology for Thailand. The present article will provide perspectives on stem cell policy roadmap and propose critical action plans for the next five-year period.","bioethics; health care policy; human; investment; legal aspect; medical technology; short survey; stem cell; Thailand; Decision Making; Health Planning; Health Policy; Humans; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Transplantation; Technology, Medical; Thailand",,Short Survey,Scopus

However, a substantial number of patients are either primarily refractory or acquire resistance to imatinib. While a number of mechanisms are known to confer resistance to imatinib, increasing evidence has demonstrated a role for BCR-ABL - independent pathways. The Src-family kinases (SFKs) are one such pathway and have been implicated in imatinib resistance. Additionally, these kinases are key to the progression of CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). The dual SFK/BCR-ABL inhibitor dasatinib is now clinically available and has markedly greater potency compared with imatinib against native BCR-ABL and the majority of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. Therefore, this agent, as well as other dual SFK/BCR-ABL inhibitors under development, could provide added therapeutic advantages by overcoming both BCR-ABL - dependent (i.e. BCR-ABL mutations) and - independent forms of imatinib resistance and delaying transition to advanced phase disease. In this review, we discuss the preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrating the involvement of SFKs in imatinib resistance and the progression of CML and Ph+ ALL, as well as the potential role of dual SFK/BCR-ABL inhibition in the management of these diseases.","BCR ABL protein; dasatinib; ephrin receptor; hematopoietic cell kinase; imatinib; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 2; platelet derived growth factor receptor; protein kinase Fyn; protein kinase Lck; protein kinase Yes; protein tyrosine kinase; STAT5 protein; stem cell factor; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; antineoplastic activity; B lymphocyte; bone marrow cell; cancer regression; cancer survival; carcinogenesis; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell survival; chronic myeloid leukemia; clinical trial; disease course; disease free survival; disease model; drug efficacy; drug marketing; drug megadose; drug potency; drug targeting; enzyme inhibition; evidence based medicine; gene mutation; human; malignant transformation; nonhuman; overall survival; Philadelphia 1 chromosome; priority journal; protein conformation; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; review; signal transduction; T lymphocyte; treatment outcome; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl; Humans; Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive; Piperazines; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Pyrimidines; Signal Transduction; src-Family Kinases",,Review,Scopus

It is plausible that the expansion of national and international research efforts, paired with the growing trend toward liberalizing stem cell research policies, will inevitably result in increased demand for the materials needed to conduct such research. The scarcity of human reproductive materials that are available for research generates concerns over, the emergence of a ""black market"", an increase in financial incentives for donors, and the appropriateness of current regulatory frameworks that aim to safeguard donors. In this article we explore the conceptual models for categorizing oocyte donors and analyze the use of financial incentives as well as the compensation models proposed and implemented in various jurisdictions. Finally, we propose the adoption of a mixed model that both respects altruism and provides a feasible solution to an issue that could be situated only in the context of the overall acceptability of providing financial rewards to donors of human reproductive materials for assisted reproductive technologies. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The survey collected data exclusively via a secure internet website on 1133 patients for a total of 6501 treatments. Unlike our prior registries, information on stem cell infusions was gathered. Information gathered included patient demographics, medical history, treatment diagnoses, treatment specifics (type, methodology, access type, anticoagulants, drugs, and equipment usage), side-effects, clinical response, and payment provider. As in the prior International Apheresis Registries for 1983, 2000, and 2002 the survey results highlight the regional differences in apheresis usage and treatment methodologies, indicating that an international overview of apheresis may be more representative of the impact of this therapeutic modality. © 2007 International Society for Apheresis.","anticoagulant agent; anamnesis; apheresis; article; clinical practice; demography; economic aspect; human; marketing; priority journal; stem cell; technology; Adult; Aged; Asia; Australia; Blood Component Removal; Europe; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; North America; Registries; South America; Time Factors",,Article,Scopus

Posaconazole, a structural analogue of itraconazole that was approved for marketing in the United States in 2006, appears to be a promising antifungal agent. Objective: This article provides an overview of the pharmacology, efficacy, and tolerability of posaconazole when used for the prophylaxis and treatment of various common and rare fungal infections. Methods: Relevant information was identified through a search of MEDLINE (1966-April 2007), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-April 2007), and abstracts of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy using the terms posaconazole and SCH 56592. Additional resources were found by searching the reference lists of the identified articles and the US Food and Drug Administration Web site. Results: Posaconazole is available as an oral suspension. It is highly distributed to various sites, including bone, the central nervous system, and eye tissue. Its Vd is 2447 L when administered in multiple daily doses (up to 800 mg/d) in the presence of a high-fat meal. Because it is excreted mostly as unchanged drug in the feces (77%), posaconazole can be administered to patients with poor renal function without any dose adjustment. Posaconazole has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against a wide variety of fungi, including those that are rare and relatively resistant. Two clinical trials have compared posaconazole with fluconazole or itraconazole for the prophylaxis of IFIs in immunocompromised patients. The first, a randomized, double-blind trial in 600 recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants, found that overall rates of IFI did not differ significantly between posaconazole and fluconazole (5% vs 9%, respectively). The other, a randomized, open-label trial in 602 neutropenic patients, reported significantly fewer IFIs in patients receiving posaconazole compared with those receiving fluconazole or itraconazole (>2% vs >8%, respectively; P = 0.001). An additional 2 trials have investigated posaconazole for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) in patients with HIV infection. A randomized, controlled, evaluator-blinded study in 350 HIV-infected patients with OPC found similar 14-day clinical success rates with posaconazole and fluconazole (91.7% and 92.5%, respectively; 95% CI, -6.6l to 5.04), whereas an open-label study in 176 HIV-infected patients with a history of refractory OPC reported a 28-day clinical success rate of 75%. Numerous small studies and case reports have described successful posaconazole treatment of zygomycosis, aspergillosis, fusariosis, endemic dimorphic fungal infection, and superficial and subcutaneous fungal infections that were refractory to conventional antifungal agents or in patients who were unable to tolerate these agents. Posaconazole has been well tolerated. The most common complaints have been gastrointestinal in nature, including nausea (7%-8%) and diarrhea (3%-11%), although these have rarely led to permanent discontinuation of therapy. Other common adverse effects have included vomiting (4%-7%), headache (2%-8%), and liver enzyme elevations (2%-3%). Conclusions: Posaconazole suspension administered at up to 800 mg/d is a reasonable alternative to conventional antifungal agents for the prevention and treatment of IFIs in high-risk populations. It may also be suitable in patients with infections caused by rare or relatively resistant fungi, and those who are unable to tolerate long-term therapy with other antifungal agents. © 2007 Excerpta Medica, Inc.","amphotericin B; antiarrhythmic agent; antifungal agent; antineoplastic agent; antiretrovirus agent; benzodiazepine derivative; calcium channel blocking agent; cyclosporin; disopyramide; docetaxel; fluconazole; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; immunosuppressive agent; itraconazole; lidocaine; nevirapine; paclitaxel; phenytoin; posaconazole; quinidine; rifabutin; sildenafil; tacrolimus; tricyclic antidepressant agent; Vinca alkaloid; voriconazole; abdominal pain; antifungal activity; article; aspergillosis; biliary tract disease; central nervous system disease; diarrhea; drug absorption; drug cost; drug distribution; drug efficacy; drug excretion; drug structure; drug tolerability; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; liver disease; long term care; minimum inhibitory concentration; mucormycosis; mycosis; nausea; opportunistic infection; oropharynx candidiasis; side effect; vomiting; Administration, Oral; AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections; Antibiotics, Antifungal; Aspergillosis; Candidiasis; Drug Resistance, Fungal; Graft vs Host Disease; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Mycoses; Tissue Distribution; Triazoles",,Article,Scopus

These rearrangements resemble the aberrations observed in therapy-related leukemias following treatment with topoisomerase II (topoII)-inhibiting agents such as etoposide. Since flavonoids are potent topoII inhibitors, we examined the role of three widely consumed dietary flavonoids (quercetin, genistein and kaempferol) on the development of MLL rearrangements in primary human CD34+ cells. Using the neutral Comet assay, we demonstrated a dose-dependent double-strand break (DSB) formation after exposure to flavonoids. An incorrect repair of these DSBs resulted in chromosomal translocations that co-localized with those identified in infant leukemias. Most of these translocations were formed by microhomology-mediated end joining. Moreover, in all but one translocation, SINE/Alu or LINE/L1 repetitive elements were present in at least one side of the breakpoint junction. Beside MLL translocations, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated monosomy or trisomy of MLL in 8-10% of the quercetin-exposed CD34+ cells. Our study demonstrates that biologically relevant concentrations of flavonoids can induce MLL abnormalities in primary hematopoietic progenitor cells. This is particularly alarming knowing that the differences in metabolism and excretion rate between mother and fetus can lead to a higher flavonoid concentration on the fetal side. Therefore, it is important to raise public awareness and set guidelines for marketing flavonoid supplements to reduce the risk of infant leukemias. © The Author 2007.

CD52 is expressed by a variety of lymphoid neoplasms and most human mononuclear cell subsets. In 2001, alemtuzumab was approved for marketing in the United States and Europe for use in patients with fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In heavily pretreated patients with CLL, the overall response rate (ORR) is approximately 35%, and in previously untreated patients the ORR is greater than 80%, with a recent randomized study suggesting it is superior to alkylator-based therapy. Importantly, alemtuzumab is effective in patients with high-risk del(17p13.1) and del(11q22.3) CLL. Alemtuzumab combination studies with fludarabine and/or monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab have demonstrated promising results. Alemtuzumab is also being studied in CLL patients as consolidation therapy for treatment of minimal residual disease, in preparation for stem cell transplantation and to prevent acute and chronic graft versus host disease. Alemtuzumab is frequently associated with acute 'first-dose' reactions when administered intravenously, but is much better tolerated when administered subcutaneously without loss of therapeutic efficacy. Additional potential adverse events associated with alemtuzumab administration include myelosuppression as well as profound cellular immune dysfunction with the associated risk of viral reactivation and other opportunistic infections. Additional studies detailing the mechanism of action of alemtuzumab as well as new strategies for prevention of opportunistic infections will aid in the future therapeutic development of this agent. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.","aciclovir; alemtuzumab; CD52 antigen; chlorambucil; cyclophosphamide; diphenhydramine; famciclovir; fludarabine; ganciclovir; hydrocortisone; paracetamol; rituximab; valaciclovir; acute graft versus host disease; autologous stem cell transplantation; bone marrow suppression; cancer palliative therapy; cancer survival; cardiotoxicity; cellular immunodeficiency; chickenpox; chromosome 11q; chromosome 17q; chronic graft versus host disease; chronic lymphatic leukemia; clinical trial; combination chemotherapy; cytomegalovirus infection; drug dosage form comparison; drug dose escalation; drug dose regimen; drug efficacy; drug induced disease; drug mechanism; drug safety; drug targeting; drug treatment failure; dyspnea; fever; gene deletion; herpes simplex; herpes zoster; high risk population; human; induced hypotension; infection prevention; injection site reaction; invasive candidiasis; male sterility; meningitis; monotherapy; mucormycosis; multiple cycle treatment; nausea; neutropenia; opportunistic infection; outcome assessment; Pneumocystis pneumonia; pneumonia; priority journal; rash; review; rigor; side effect; survival rate; thrombocytopenia; treatment duration; treatment planning; treatment response; Varicella zoster virus; virus reactivation; vomiting; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Neoplasm; Antigens, CD; Antigens, Neoplasm; Cyclophosphamide; Glycoproteins; Humans; Immunotherapy; Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic; Vidarabine",,Review,Scopus

Most of the effects of CysLTs that are relevant to the pathophysiology of asthma are mediated by the activation of the CysLT1 receptor, one of the receptor subtypes for CysLTs. LTB4 might be functionally involved in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness, acute and severe asthma and allergic rhinitis. CysLT1 receptor antagonists can be given as monotherapy or in addition to inhaled glucocorticoids. The potential anti-remodeling effect of CysLT1 receptor antagonists might be relevant for preventing or reversing airway structural changes in asthmatic patients.

Four months later, 14 phase II clinical trial participants who received novel GO-containing combination chemotherapy regimens developed an unexpected hepatic toxicity termed sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS) or hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Investigators associated with the Research on Adverse Drug Events and Reports (RADAR) project reviewed safety reports for GO included in reports of clinical trials and observational studies, interim reports from an FDA mandated Prospective Observational Registry, and the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System. Medline searches provided incidence estimates of GO-associated SOS and comparative rates of SOS without GO. SOS is characterized by hyperbilirubinemia, painful hepatomegaly, ascites, and sudden weight gain developing at a median of 10 days following GO administration for patients who did not undergo an allogeneic SCT procedure and 13 days following an allogeneic SCT for patients who had previously received GO. Among adult AML patients who received GO in clinical trials, SOS incidence was 3% at doses ≤6 mg/m2 if administered as monotherapy or in combination with non-hepatotoxic agents versus 28% if administered with thioguanine and 15% when administered as monotherapy at a dose of 9 mg/m2. Observational studies identified SOS rates between 15% and 40% if an SCT is performed within 3 months of GO administration. The FDA mandated Prospective Observational Registry of patients who receive care at 60 medical centers has identified GO-associated SOS rates of 14% if an SCT is performed and 9% otherwise. Caution is advised when administering GO in routine clinical practice, particularly if administered with other hepatotoxic agents, at doses and schedules more intensive than those approved by the FDA, or within 3 months of a SCT procedure. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

DOR BioPharma has also filed an MAA in Europe for the same indication. orBec® is designed to reduce the need for systemic immunosuppressive drugs, thereby improving the outcome of bone marrow and stem cell transplantation. DOR BioPharma may seek a marketing partner in the US and elsewhere for orBec® in GVHD and will seek a partner for other potential indications of the drug. In December 2001, Corporate Technology Development was acquired by Endorex Corporation (now DOR BioPharma). In October 1998, Enteron Pharmaceuticals (DOR BioPharma) entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty bearing license agreement with George B. McDonald, MD, including the right to grant sublicenses, for the rights to the intellectual property and know-how relating to orBec®. In January 2007, DOR BioPharma received $US3 million under a non-binding letter of intent from Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals. The agreement grants Sigma-Tau an exclusive right to negotiate terms and conditions for a possible business transaction or strategic alliance regarding orBec® and potentially other DOR pipeline compounds until 1 March 2007. Under the terms of the agreement, Sigma-Tau purchased $US1 million of DOR's common stock, with an additional $US2 million paid in cash. If no agreement is reached by 1 March 2007, DOR will return the $US2 million to Sigma-Tau within 60 days.[1] DOR BioPharma received an unsolicited proposal from Cell Therapeutics, Inc. to acquire DOR BioPharma in January 2007. Because of the non-binding agreement already signed with Sigma-Tau, DOR BioPharma's board of directors cannot consider Cell Therapeutics' merger proposal at this time. [2] orBec® has been filed for approval in the US for the treatment of gastrointestinal GVHD. The US FDA accepted the NDA filing and has established a target date of 21 July 2007 for completion of review of the NDA. In November 2006, the EMEA determined that the MAA for orBec® for the treatment of gastrointestinal GVHD is complete and that the review process has begun.[3] The data provided in the MAA and NDA submissions demonstrate that orBec® safely provides a lower risk of mortality compared with the current standard of care. Both filings are supported by data from two randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials. The first was a 129-patient pivotal phase III clinical trial for orBec® conducted at 16 bone marrow/stem cell transplant centres in the US and France. The second trial was a 60-patient phase II clinical trial conducted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre. In the primary endpoint of its pivotal trial, time to treatment failure through day 50, orBec® failed to achieve statistical significance (p-value 0.1177). However, orBec® did achieve statistical significance in the secondary endpoints of time to treatment failure through day 80, and a reduction in mortality compared with placebo. In this trial, patient survival at the prespecified endpoint of 200 days post-transplant showed a statistically significant 66% reduction in mortality among patients randomised to orBec®. DOR BioPharma believes the primary endpoint was not achieved due to a higher than expected rate of treatment failures during the initial 10 days in both treatment groups.[4] The mortality benefit in favour of orBec® was confirmed in a retrospective analysis of the phase II study, in which there was a 55% reduction in mortality at 200 days post-transplant. At 1 year after randomisation, there were relatively consistent 51% and 45% reductions in the risk of mortality among patients randomised to orBec® in both the phase III and phase II studies, respectively.[3] DOR BioPharma is also conducting a phase II clinical trial to investigate orBec® in the prevention of gastrointestinal GVHD. DOR BioPharma has executed an exclusive licence agreement with the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston for the use of oral luminally active anti-inflammatory drugs, such as orBec®, for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. © 2007 Adis Data Information BV.

Plerixafor was synthesised by Johnson Matthey (AnorMED) in collaboration with the Rega Institute of Leuven, Belgium. Plerixafor is in phase III clinical trials in stem cell transplantation among cancer patients. Plerixafor blocks CXCR4, which triggers the rapid movement of stem cells out of the bone marrow and into circulating blood. These cells can then be collected and used in stem cell transplant procedures. Plerixafor had been available for partnering in Europe. However, decisions concerning partnering arrangements were deferred by AnorMED until top-line clinical data became available (expected in 2007). In November 2006, Genzyme Corporation completed its acquisition of AnorMED. Genzyme intends to commercialise plerixafor in &gt;50 countries throughout the world using its existing transplant business.[1] Evotec OAI was selected by AnorMED to support it in the chemical development of plerixafor. Evotec OAI will use EVOdevelop™, its integrated chemical and pharmaceutical development platform, to complete the full validation of the process to plerixafor, including process research and development, cGMP manufacturing and analytical work. Evotec OAI will also be responsible for producing the relevant Chemical Manufacturing Control (CMC) documentation for regulatory filings.[2] Top line results from the phase III studies are expected in the second quarter of 2007 and, assuming these are successful, the marketing submissions are planned for the US in 2007 (launch in 2008), and for Canada and Europe in 2008.[3,4] Plerixafor has orphan drug status for stem cell transplantation in cancer patients in the US and the EU. [5,6] AnorMED (now Genzyme) decided to pursue a full Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) in Europe for plerixafor in stem cell transplant. Previously, the company had been planning on filing a CMA (Conditional Marketing Authorisation) in this region. The change in strategy requires additional phase II trials in the five major EU markets. [6,7] Multicentre phase II trials with plerixafor have begun in Canada and Germany in approximately 50 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma (studies EU21 and C201).[8] Enrolment has been completed in a US-based, multicentre, phase II trial (study 2105) of plerixafor plus G-CSF in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study is designed to optimise the administration schedule of this combination therapy regimen.[9] Plerixafor has completed a phase II study (study 2104) in multiple myeloma and NHL patients in combination with chemotherapy. A US-based phase II pilot study (study 2108) with plerixafor as a single mobilising agent in multiple myeloma patients undergoing stem cell transplant is underway. Another US-based phase II pilot study (study 2106) is evaluating plerixafor in combination with the standard mobilisation regimen, G-CSF, in patients with Hodgkin's disease undergoing stem cell transplant.[10] AnorMED completed a phase II study (study 2101) evaluating the potential of plerixafor in combination with G-CSF as a therapy for stem cell transplantation compared to G-CSF therapy alone. The study involved patients with multiple myeloma and patients with NHL. Results indicated that the combination regimen was significantly superior to G-CSF treatment alone in stem cell mobilisation.[11] Further trials are planned for plerixafor, to expand its use in transplant and in other indications including one to investigate the potential of plerixafor to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with leukaemia.[3,7] Phase I trials have been completed.[12,13] © 2007 Adis Data Information BV.

However, In reality, the marriage of a test with therapy will not be a simple one, since each industry operates with its own distinct business model. Of concern to the pharmaceutical industry is the potential commercial dependency of a drug on the performance and implementation of a diagnostic. These concerns are justified since the history of diagnostic tests is frequently one of under use. One of the factors cited by Rogers is the issue of how complex an innovation is to administer. Rogers demonstrates that an innovation that is difficult to administer will be implemented more slowly or be discontinued by the user group it was intended for. It is the author's view that understanding this micro interaction, experience and barriers of testing with the individual provider, in short the complexity of the test, will, in turn, provide those in the pharmaceutical industry with a methodology to consider their risk or exposure to a test upon which their therapy may become dependent in the US market. Since personalized medicine significantly marries the test and treatment decision, it is the perspective of the provider that will be paramount in determining which, if any, test is ordered and the subsequent clinical decision he or she is enabled to take upon the test response. Therefore, a focus of this perspective is to consider the issues of test implementation from the perspective of the US provider who will order and use the information they provide. The Opportunity To Test Index methodology is introduced, which the authors speculate may help quantify the level of risk a pharmaceutical company has to the complexity of a test upon which its therapy will be dependent. The methodology scores five key elements impacting test implementation: reimbursement, turnaround time, test administration, test interpretation and patient engagement. © 2006 Future Medicine Ltd.","antiretrovirus agent; brain natriuretic peptide; BRCA1 protein; BRCA2 protein; cyclin dependent kinase 2; cyclin dependent kinase 2a; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; glucuronosyltransferase 1A1; hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate; imatinib; immunosuppressive agent; irinotecan; mercaptopurine; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonist; phospholipase A2; protein p16; stem cell factor receptor; thiopurine methyltransferase; trastuzumab; troponin; unclassified drug; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; article; breast cancer; chronic myeloid leukemia; clinical practice; colon cancer; data analysis; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic test; drug choice; drug indication; drug industry; drug marketing; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fluorescence in situ hybridization; health care delivery; health insurance; heart disease; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunohistochemistry; laboratory automation; medical decision making; medical technology; patient care planning; patient counseling; patient guidance; pharmacogenomics; practice guideline; priority journal; reimbursement; risk assessment; treatment indication; turnaround time; United States; validation process",,Article,Scopus

The major anti-cancer activity indicators of these agents included inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis to cancer cells. In addition, cytotoxicity and myelosuppressive activity to normal cells were parameters to evaluate toxicity of these drugs. Methods: Using a panel of cell-based assay systems, we investigated activity and toxicity properties of selected cancer drugs. Drug effects on a number of normal and cancer cell types from human origin were evaluated. Results: Topoisomerase inhibitors (camptothecin, doxorubicin and etoposide) and microtubule inhibitors (colchicine and paclitaxel) showed anti-proliferation activity and induced apoptosis in MDA-231 cancer cells. Except for doxorubicin, these drugs had relatively low toxicity to normal cells because the dosage required for cytotoxicity EC50 was &gt; 200-folds higher than the dosage for anti-proliferation EC50 in cancer cells (MDA-231, HL60). However, these drugs were potent inducers of myelotoxicity in human bone marrow progenitor cells. In comparison, the DNA alkylating agents (cisplatin and carboplatin) were less potent proliferation inhibitors (EC50 &gt; 10 μM) in MDA-231 cells and they were also less myelosuppressive. Discussion: Using marketed drugs as examples, our study established a multiple assay platform for profiling in vitro properties of cancer drugs. In drug discovery, such a platform will help to expedite lead selection at early stage. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

But as we have seen, even a combination of the best target validation approaches that exists today cannot provide more than a reasonable degree of confidence to proceed to the next step (usually, target screening). Target validation and suitability is interpreted differently at different time points by different experts during drug discovery and should be reevaluated on an ongoing basis. Ultimately, only compounds and patients can validate targets (Fig. 3). Often, companies must validate targets for a specific disease indication, due to specific marketing or developmental opportunities. Particularly, where such constraints exist, it is essential to solicit information for targets from a variety of assays and models and to combine all DGE, genetics, and other data that relate to the disease situation in patients. Drug discovery is still a compartmentalized process, where decisions are taken by experts with very limited scope of the overall procedure, guided by a ""target profile"" in wish-list format that leaves no room for opportunities or surprises. This situation has been reinforced by the mergers that took place in the drug discovery industry during the 1990s, which appear to have sacrificed innovation for improved efficiency through scale enlargement. The approach has been to focus on a target, to screen (hundreds of) thousands of molecules, and to proceed in very small steps forward. The new approaches, under a variety of ideas and names (systems biology, biology- or pathway-driven drug discovery), allow for ""skipping"" a number of these minute steps, investigating fewer paths, but taking them deeper (jumping checkpoints), allowing leaps into directions that would have looked unpromising in the short term. Intellectually dissatisfying, ""systems biology"" also implies letting go of understanding every aspect of a drug at every step. In this context, it may be useful to reflect on drugs that were successful precisely because they did not target exclusively a single target (although many of them started out on a single one) or disease. Gleevec would have very limited use (and market value) if it really only targeted, as intended, the oncogenic form of c-abl. Instead, this piece of medical ""shrapnel"" [46] also targets other oncogenes such as c-Kit and has much wider use in cancer than for the relatively rare, initially considered group of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. Gleevec and similar drugs were successfully discovered through screening on a single target, but this approach may not be the most efficient one for this kind of discovery. ""Dirty drugs,"" i.e., compounds that target multiple targets, may well be much more effective (active at lower doses) than the ""one compound, one target, one disease"" paradigm. High dosing of a single gene-targeting drug involves risks for toxicity and drug-drug interactions [47]. Two recently approved cancer drugs (Sutent/sunitinib and Nexavar) each hit multiple tyrosine kinases; several other such drugs (Zactima, AG-013736) are in development. Pyremidinediones are new, potent HIV inhibitors (Samjin, Seoul, South Korea) that target both reverse transcriptase and virus entry. Even companies that develop siRNAs as therapeutics and which have a unique opportunity to produce selective drugs realize that targeting single genes may not be the best way forward: Topigen (Montreal, Canada) is developing ASM8, a mixture of oligonucleotides. One oligo targets the common subunit of the receptor for IL3, -5, GM-CSF, and CSF, the second blocks CCR3. It would indeed appear very naïve to believe that the human immune system, which has (so far) successfully withstood the perennial siege of countless generations of highly subversive and innovative pathogens, would let itself be manipulated today through a single target. The logical next step is therefore to combine drugs, as is already the case for HIV infection or cancer chemotherapy. There is no good reason to believe that a set of low-dosed compounds is inherently more dangerous than a single highly dosed one. The view that complete target validation can (must) be done in absence of (prior to) actual drug discovery is a strongly deterministic one. A more pragmatic approach that lets (partially) go of reductionism does not mean we should drop rational approaches, such as the placebo-controlled double-blind test, systematic high-throughput assays, chemical structure-analysis, or robust statistics. Systems biology is an integral part of rational, evidence-based medicine. It is worrisome that so many drugs presently in use would not have passed today's animal safety tests. We cannot recommend suicidal individuals to make more creative use of drug candidates, but we can attempt to better understand metabolic differences between humans and laboratory animals and discover ways to more accurately predict human toxicity in vitro, using human materials (stem cells-derived?) as proxy models. The overall recommendation for drug discovery would be to go back to its roots and the tradition that medicine is more of an art than a science that uses genetics and target evaluation ""merely"" as a means to reach its goals.

It affects millions of people worldwide independent of age, sex and race. The prevalence increases with age and is relatively higher in women compared with men. The treatment of OAB is aimed at reducing the debilitating symptoms so as to improve the overall quality of life for patients. Anticholinergic agents targeting the muscarinic receptors in the bladder represent the mainstay of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of OAB. Besides their status as the current standard of care, use of antimuscarinic drugs is limited by certain side effects, particularly dry mouth and constipation; therefore, various attempts have been made to improve the organ selectivity of these drugs to overcome the side effects. These include the development of new antimuscarinic agents with structural modifications and the use of innovative drug delivery methods. The advancement in the drug delivery systems extends to the long-term therapeutic efficacy with improved tolerability and patient compliance; however, future prospective therapies are aimed at novel targets with novel mechanisms of action, including β3-adrenoceptor agonists, K+ channel openers, 5-HT modulators and botulinum toxin, which are currently under different stages of clinical development. Among other investigational therapies, neurokinin receptor antagonists, α-adrenoceptor antagonists, nerve growth factor inhibitors, gene therapy and stem cell-based therapies are of considerable interest. The future for the development of new modalities for the treatment of OAB looks promising. © 2006 Informa UK Ltd.","a 278637; alpha adrenergic receptor blocking agent; anturol; ap 1034; beta 3 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; botulinum toxin; botulinum toxin A; cholinergic receptor blocking agent; darifenacin; fesoterodine; imidafenacin; kuc 7483; muscarinic receptor; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; n (4 benzoylphenyl) 3,3,3 trifluoro 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropionamide; ncc 220; nerve growth factor; ns 309; nx 303; ono 8025; oxybutynin; placebo; potassium channel stimulating agent; psd 506; purine receptor; ritobegron; serotonin receptor affecting agent; solabegron; solifenacin; tachykinin receptor antagonist; theraderm mtx; tolterodine; trospium chloride; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; ym 205; zd 0947; age distribution; anticholinergic effect; application site erythema; application site pruritus; blurred vision; chemical modification; clinical trial; constipation; controlled release formulation; disease exacerbation; drug absorption; drug bioavailability; drug blood level; drug cost; drug delivery system; drug design; drug efficacy; drug marketing; drug selectivity; drug targeting; drug tolerability; dysphagia; first pass effect; gene therapy; human; nausea; nocturia; nonhuman; overactive bladder; patient care; patient compliance; prevalence; quality of life; review; sex ratio; side effect; single drug dose; stem cell transplantation; urge incontinence; urinary frequency; urinary urgency; visual disorder; vomiting; xerostomia; Animals; Drug Carriers; Drug Design; Gene Therapy; Humans; Muscarinic Antagonists; Urinary Bladder, Overactive",,Review,Scopus

Although it is an effective therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS), the serious adverse effect of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulted in its voluntary withdrawal from the market by Biogen Idec/Elan in February 2005. This has raised debates on whether PML was caused by blocking leukocyte trafficking-mediated immune suppression or by other effects through targeting α4 integrin per se. The authors propose that natalizumab-associated PML is a target-specific side effect predominantly due to the combination of: i) blocking leukocyte trafficking to peripheral organs resulting in reduced immune surveillance; ii) mobilisation of PML-causative JC virus-carrying bone marrow precursor cells and splenic marginal zone B cells; and iii) migration of these cells to sites of inflammation such as the brain. Therefore, combination of these effects is, so far, specific for the target α4 integrin and should not occur in general when interfering with other targets involved in leukocyte trafficking. © 2006 Informa UK Ltd.","alpha4 integrin; azathioprine; beta interferon; beta1a interferon; cyclophosphamide; efalizumab; glatiramer; infliximab; methotrexate; natalizumab; neutralizing antibody; placebo; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; very late activation antigen 4; B lymphocyte; cell migration; cell transport; circulation; clinical trial; Crohn disease; depression; drug fatality; drug industry; drug marketing; drug mechanism; drug targeting; drug withdrawal; editorial; encephalitis; hematopoietic stem cell; human; hypersensitivity reaction; immunosuppressive treatment; immunosurveillance; infection; JC virus; leukocyte; multiple sclerosis; nonhuman; progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; protein expression; psoriasis vulgaris; rheumatoid arthritis; spleen cell; T lymphocyte activation; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Cell Adhesion; Clinical Trials; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; JC Virus; Leukocytes; Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal; Multiple Sclerosis; Product Surveillance, Postmarketing; Risk Factors",,Editorial,Scopus

However, drug development for these conditions has been limited by a lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms of disease and the relative unavailability of subjects for clinical trials, as well as the prohibitive cost of investing in a novel pharmaceutical agent with poor market potential. Nevertheless, the introduction of Orphan Drug legislations has provided important incentives for the development of orphan drugs (i.e. drugs that have been abandoned or 'orphaned' by major drug companies). Moreover, recent studies on rare diseases, including inherited immunodeficiencies and metabolic disorders, have served not only to alleviate the plight of patients with rare diseases, but also yielded valuable information on biological processes of relevance for other, more common conditions.

Most young firms concentrated on the generation and storage of stem cells, the development of tissues and related equipment. But the perspectives of therapeutic use of stem cells attract a lot of political and commercial attention to possible new strategic markets opening up new fields besides incumbent bio-pharmaceutical segments. The paper compares experiences of market emergence in recombinant drugs market as a typical bio-pharmaceutical market with the current situation in stem cell business. The results of this comparison lead to policy recommendations for nurturing stem cell business stressing particularly the role of examination knowledge and sales markets.

Less widely acknowledged, but as critical, cultural industries also create products that serve important symbolic functions such as capturing, refracting, and legitimating societal knowledge and values. For example, educational publishers influence what concepts and theories are promoted to students by the books they publish. Architects shape the sensibilities of interactions at work, home, and play by their choice of technologies, space design, and material resources. Music producers discover and promote vocal artists whose lyrics shape our understandings of age, gender, and ethnicity. Because of the societal impact of these symbolic functions, cultural industries have continued to interest both popular writers and sociologists alike. However, to a large degree the cultural industries have been considered unique and out of the mainstream, not a subject for developing general theory, and therefore relatively understudied by scholars of organizations. We argue it is no longer the case that cultural industries are so unique - representing small markets and industries of little matter to research in the sociology of organizations. Cultural industries are now one of the fastest growing and most vital sectors in the US and global economies (United States Census Reports, 2000). This growth is fueled in a large part by the nature of the knowledge, creative, and symbolic assets of cultural industries. These assets are increasingly the key underlying drivers of innovation and competitiveness in both national and global economies (Florida, 2002). In this volume we attempt to recognize that the functions of the symbolic, creative, and knowledge-based assets of cultural industries are also characteristic of the professional services industries as well, for example as design services, advertising, and even the more mundane services of auditing. Design services, one of the fastest growing areas in the US economy (United States Census Reports, 2000), employs symbolic, knowledge and creative assets to create desirable products for clients and consumers. Brand and product marketing has shifted from its primary focus on price and location to aesthetics, identity, and image management (Schmitt & Simonson, 1997). Even audit practices involve not only knowledge of standard accounting procedures, but more importantly the creative interpretation of complex tax codes, and the creation of symbols of public confidence in corporate practices. Yet few scholars have explored how cultural, professional services, and other industries illuminate one other. While a large part of our research and knowledge in the field of sociology stems from the study of the decreasing returns industries based in the economic traditions of land, labor, financial capital, and the industrial corporation (Chandler, 1962; Arthur, 1996; Fligstein, 1990), the US Census data reveal that these industries in all likelihood will not be the key drivers of the economy in the future. Instead, increasingly, those industries driven by creative workers and the professions - with organizing principles based in knowledge and aesthetics - combined in novel ways with the institutional logics of the market and the corporation - will be the industries to shape the new views of organizations and our understandings of institutional and organizational change. To date, we have a few descriptive and conceptual pieces with initial explorations such as Hirsch's (1975) comparison of the record and pharmaceutical industries, Powell's (1990) discussion of the convergence of biotech, high tech, film, music, and book publishing as network organizations, and Jones, Hesterly, & Borgatti (1997) examination of similarities among semiconductors, auto manufacturing, airplane outsourcing, and film for the application of network governance. We believe that scholarly work, however, has not yet cultivated insights from these cross connections to help us to understand institutional and organizational change. Indeed, in this volume our journey into the realm of cultural industries produces insights that would not be revealed in a Chandlerian (Chandler, 1962,1977) or Fligsteinian (Fligstein, 1990, 1996) world of organizations. By examining the ways in which participants of cultural industries organize and accomplish their goals, our attention is focused on fresh sociological insights and new challenges in the study of organizations. Given these transformational changes, the manuscripts in this volume illustrate how the boundaries become blurred between cultural and other related industries that also rest upon the endeavors of creative workers. In particular, we see these blending processes in the chapters that examine cell phones, television critics, accounting, and architecture. These dynamic interactions in the commercial landscape between the cultural and professional service industries provide a richer context for the authors in this volume to examine changes in a specific market or industry, and also to advance more generally our knowledge of the latest theoretical and methodological tools sociologists have to offer in understanding the institutional transformation of organizations. We are delighted to present these studies to you. Djelic and Ainamo (2005) explore the transpositions in institutional logics from the realm of aesthetic fashion to that of high technology in the context of the market for the emergent technology of cell phones. One of their findings points to the need for scope conditions on one of the key umbrella concepts of contemporary organization theory. Djelic and Ainamo show that the distinction between technical and institutional environments (Meyer & Rowan, 1977; Scott & Meyer, 1983), may well be in the era of market capitalism - a more mercurial one. They show for example how the transposition of a fashion logic into the high technology market for cell phones is at the same time utilitarian and cultural, albeit a product designed and marketed to customer expression. Moreover, the agents or institutional entrepreneurs responsible for blurring the boundaries of the aesthetic and the utilitarian are not always rational actors and pioneers with unique inventions (DiMaggio, 1988). Institutional entrepreneurs do not start from scratch but piece together and recombine cultural elements available in society in ways that often involve creative discovery as well as happenstance (Thornton, 2004). Worth's innovation of the modular dress, where component dress parts - sleeves, skirts, bodices, cuffs, trims, what have you - were rearranged in a myriad of permutations to maximize the product differentiation of the white dress for imperial ball occasions, is the telling metaphor. We see, not only in the origins of fashion logics themselves, but also in the track record of cell phone start-ups the potential for this hybridization of fashion and technology logics with varying consequences for strategic success in the product market. Dowd, Liddle, and Blyler (2005) examine the interplay between production strategies and market concentration for the careers of creative workers. Market concentration has previously been found to limit the diversity of cultural products in the market (Mezias & Mezias, 2000). Dowd et al. assess how the product strategy of decentralization of musical performing acts mitigates the negative effects of concentration, with the effect of allowing for more diversity in cultural products as examined in a higher percentage of female acts. However, they also find that the density of female musical acts never exceeds more than 25% in contrast to their prior findings on African-American musical artists. Dowd et al. attribute this ""glass ceiling"" on female acts in the marketplace to the ""inattention"" of record label executives to female acts, reflecting society's gender bias. In short, although the consumer market may be receptive to increasing numbers of female acts, shown by the number of prior female acts that gained top song status on Billboards, there is a limit to this acceptance. This limit is demonstrated by the record companies not signing available female talent even though the success of prior women's acts should have paved a legitimizing path. Their important and timely research shows that unless production strategies are accompanied by a corollary change in societal level logics, change is unlikely to occur in cultural products available in the market. Bielby, Moloney, and Ngo (2005) point out that there has been little attention to the scholarly study of the aesthetics of popular culture. They address this gap in the literature by examining the television critic's role in an increasingly market driven world in which there are great pressures to evaluate television in terms of ""what will,"" rather than ""what should"" the audience be watching. As in the case of architecture in this volume (Thornton, Jones, and Kury), the Bielby et al. research highlights a case in which critics are situated in environments with conflicting constituencies that requires mediating between the dual demands for aesthetic and commercial evaluation. Using multidimensional scaling to generate descriptive mappings of meaning structures (Mohr, 1998), they show that, over time and during significant industry transformation, television critics attended to a remarkably consistent set of core evaluative criteria directed to these dual constituencies. ...",,,Review,Scopus

The disease-modifying treatments, IFN-β and glatiramer acetate, have been widely available over the last decade and have shown a beneficial effect on relapse rate and magnetic resonance imaging parameters of disease activity; however, their effect on disease progression and disability is modest. Therefore, the search for alternative treatment strategies continues. As understanding of the heterogeneous pathophysiology of MS has increased, emphasis has shifted to more selective therapy that targets components of the inflammatory cascade and the promotion of remyelination and neuroprotection. These agents target the blood-brain barrier, systemic immune dysfunction, local inflammation and neurodegeneration. Combination therapies are being investigated for patients who fail first-line treatments. Many new drugs are being developed and tested that address these issues with the aim of finding a more effective and convenient therapy. These include humanised monoclonal antibodies such as daclizumab (IL-2 antagonist), oral immunomodulators such as sirolimus and statins and neuroprotective agents such as NMDA antagonists and Na +-channel blockers. Many of the treatments discussed in this review are still at early stages of development, but provide exciting potential treatment options; others have proved disappointing in larger extended-phase studies. © 2005 Ashley Publications.","abt 874; alemtuzumab; azathioprine; bht 3009; chorionic gonadotropin; cnto 1275; corticosteroid; cyclophosphamide; daclizumab; e 2007; estriol; glatiramer; HLA DR antigen; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; ibudilast; immunoglobulin; immunosuppressive agent; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; mevinolin; mitoxantrone; monoclonal antibody; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor blocking agent; natalizumab; peptide derivative; phosphodiesterase inhibitor; rapamycin; recombinant beta interferon; rituximab; ro 0506997; rolipram; simvastatin; sodium channel blocking agent; talampanel; teriflunomide; tiplimotide; unindexed drug; amenorrhea; anaphylaxis; anemia; arthralgia; blood brain barrier; bone density; bone marrow toxicity; brain cancer; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular risk; cataract; chill; clinical trial; depression; disease course; dose response; drug cost; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug eruption; drug fatality; drug induced cancer; drug induced headache; drug marketing; drug mechanism; drug megadose; drug metabolism; drug safety; drug targeting; drug tolerability; dyspnea; enzyme activation; female infertility; fever; flu like syndrome; gastrointestinal symptom; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; hypersensitivity; hypertension; hypotension; immune deficiency; infection risk; inflammation; injection site reaction; leukemia; leukopenia; liver dysfunction; liver necrosis; liver toxicity; long term exposure; low drug dose; malignant neoplastic disease; mouth ulcer; multiple sclerosis; myalgia; nausea; nerve degeneration; neuroprotection; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; ovary insufficiency; paresthesia; pathophysiology; physical disability; pneumonia; progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; remyelinization; respiratory tract infection; review; rheumatoid arthritis; side effect; T lymphocyte; thrombocytopenia; treatment failure; vaccination; weight gain; Animals; Clinical Trials; Drugs, Investigational; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Multiple Sclerosis; Neuroprotective Agents",,Review,Scopus

The principal manifestations of developmental toxicity include: embryolethality, malformations, growth retardation, and functional impairment. In 2001, the European Commission published the future chemicals policy entitled ""White Paper: Strategy for a Future Chemicals Policy"". The new regulation requires a toxicological evaluation with strong emphasis on reproductive toxicity, by using in vitro methods, especially for those chemicals marketed at more than 1 ton per year. For this reason, the establishment of in vitro models capable of detecting major undesirable manifestations in the fetus, are urgently required. The aim of the present review is to explore the capacity of existing in vitro systems, based on embryonic stem (ES) cells, to identify embryotoxicity with a focus on specific effects such as teratogenicity and growth retardation. In addition, we discuss the possibility to adapt the mouse ES cells based tests to human ES cells, avoiding inter-species variations in developmental toxicity studies and address related ethical issues. Considering the different manifestations of developmental toxicity, only a battery of in vitro tests will provide the necessary information for regulatory developmental toxicity assessment.","2 ethoxyethanol; acetylsalicylic acid; alcohol; alkaline phosphatase bone isoenzyme; alpha fetoprotein; aminopterin; antineoplastic agent; bone morphogenetic protein 4; colchicine; collagen type 2; hepatocyte nuclear factor 4; hydroxyurea; lithium; methylmercury; myosin heavy chain; myosin light chain; nerve cell adhesion molecule; nestin; neurofilament protein; octamer transcription factor 4; osteocalcin; retinoid; telomerase reverse transcriptase; thalidomide; transcription factor; transcription factor GATA 4; transcription factor PAX6; transcription factor RUNX2; transcription factor Sox9; trimethadione; conception; dog; embryo; embryonic stem cell; embryotoxicity; Europe; experimental model; ferret; fetus; fetus malformation; functional disease; genetic analysis; growth retardation; guinea pig; hamster; health care organization; human; in vitro study; intrauterine growth retardation; lethality; marketing; medical assessment; medical ethics; mouse; nonhuman; policy; postnatal development; prenatal development; prenatal exposure; primate; rabbit; reproductive toxicity; research ethics; review; sexual maturation; species difference; spontaneous abortion; swine; teratogenicity; time; toxicity testing; toxicology; workshop; Abnormalities; Animal Testing Alternatives; Animals; Cell Division; Embryo; Stem Cells; Toxicology",,Review,Scopus

By April 2004, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products had already given positive opinion on 63 per cent of the 316 applications considered by them. A significant number of these positive designations have already matured into full marketing authorisations. Three major reasons - failure to meet prevalence or significant benefit criteria or provide evidence of biological plausibility - have equally contributed to either the negative opinion on or the applicants withdrawing the remaining applications. In July 2004, the European Commission issued a communication setting out its position on certain matters relating to the implementation of the designation and market exclusivity provisions. The Commission, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) continue to be proactive and provide as much guidance and incentives as practical, engaging themselves with sponsors, patient groups and academia. As experience builds up and issues are clarified, there are expectations that the Community Regulation on orphan medicines will prove to be a spectacular success. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Diseases; Laws and legislation; Marketing; Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products; Community Regulation; European Medicines Agency (EMA); Orphan medicinal products; Drug products; agalsidase alfa; agalsidase beta; anagrelide; arsenic trioxide; bosentan; busulfan; carglumic acid; celecoxib; cladribine; DNA; ibuprofen; iloprost; imatinib; immunomodulating agent; laronidase; litak; miglustat; mitotane; monoclonal antibody; new drug; nitisinone; omega conotoxin MVIIA; orphan drug; pegvisomant; photofrin; unclassified drug; wilzin; xagird; zinc acetate; acromegaly; adenomatous polyp; adrenal cortex carcinoma; article; Barrett esophagus; chronic myeloid leukemia; chronic pain; clinical protocol; drug approval; drug industry; drug marketing; European Union; experience; Fabry disease; Gaucher disease; hairy cell leukemia; health care organization; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; hyperammonemia; medicolegal aspect; mucopolysaccharidosis; patent ductus arteriosus; practice guideline; prevalence; promyelocytic leukemia; pulmonary hypertension; thrombocythemia; tyrosinemia; Wilson disease",,Article,Scopus

Current standard of care is largely empiric, involving the use of corticosteroids and toxic immune suppressive agents that are widely acknowledged to have unacceptable side effects for long-term use. Recently, there have been significant advances in understanding the nature of some fundamental immune imbalances underlying the complicated clinical manifestations of SLE. Nevertheless attempts to develop and test more targeted, and potentially safer immune-modulating drugs for lupus have encountered significant obstacles, due to the lack of validated biological markers for disease flare and remission, and difficulties in the clinical assessment of the heterogeneous patients. In support of renewed interest in drug development for lupus, large collaborative groups have formed, and efforts are underway to develop objective biomarkers for SLE as well as to improve the standardisation and reproducibility of clinical outcome measures in multi-centre trials.","abetimus; acetylsalicylic acid; antimalarial agent; azathioprine; belimumab; beta2 glycoprotein 1 antibody; corticosteroid; coumarin; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporin; dapsone; DNA antibody; edratide; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; interleukin 4 antibody; leflunomide; ljp 1082; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody idec 131; mycophenolic acid 2 morpholinoethyl ester; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; prasterone; prednisolone; prednisone; retinoid derivative; rituximab; thalidomide; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; acne; alopecia; avascular necrosis; cataract; clinical feature; clinical trial; coronary artery disease; corticosteroid induced osteoporosis; corticosteroid therapy; Cushingoid syndrome; disease activity; disease classification; drug indication; drug marketing; drug pulse therapy; drug targeting; dyslipoproteinemia; female sterility; human; immunotherapy; infection; inflammation; leukopenia; life expectancy; lipodystrophy; liver dysfunction; long term care; male sterility; metabolic disorder; nephrotoxicity; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; obesity; osteoporosis; plasmapheresis; remission; review; side effect; stem cell transplantation; systemic lupus erythematosus; thromboembolism; transaminitis; treatment outcome; weight gain; Drug Delivery Systems; Drugs, Investigational; Humans; Immunotherapy; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic",,Review,Scopus

Although various types of collagens, adhesion glycoproteins, growth factors, and chemokines are present in the extracellular matrices in tissue- and temporal-specific manners, a large fraction of the bioactivity is carried by its sugar component, and especially the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. Because tissue morphogenesis is mediated by multiple ECM influences and by multiple active sites on these components, it is now becoming clear that heparan sulfates play major roles in orchestrating these complex arrangements, particularly during growth and repair processes. Because of their extractability, robustness, and resistance to chemical treatment, biologically active, ECM-derived sugars seem to be well placed for use in tissue repair, regeneration, and engineering. They also seem to have a promising future in ""programming"" stem cells for tissue replacement. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","cell surface protein; chemokine; collagen; enoxaparin; fibroblast growth factor; glycoprotein; glypican; growth factor; heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan; heparin; heparin derivative; perlecan; syndecan; unclassified drug; blood clot lysis; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; complex formation; drug activity; drug design; drug marketing; drug protein binding; drug receptor binding; drug structure; drug synthesis; extracellular matrix; glycocalyx; human; morphogenesis; nonhuman; osteoporosis; protein protein interaction; review; sequence analysis; side effect; stem cell; thrombocytopenia; tissue engineering; wound healing",,Review,Scopus

Despite treatment advances, including hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation to facilitate administration of high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy, the median survival remains approximately 3 years and long-term remissions are rare. Bortezomib (Velcade, formerly known as PS-341; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge MA) is a dipeptide boronic acid that inhibits the 20S proteasome involved in the degradation of intracellular proteins, including those affecting cell cycle regulation in mammalian cells. Described herein are the analyses by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of clinical and nonclinical data submitted in the New Drug Application. Chemistry manufacturing and controls, animal toxicology, and biopharmaceutical data are described. The results of Phase I and Phase II clinical studies in patients with multiple myeloma are summarized. The marketing approval and postmarketing commitments are discussed. Results: Toxicology studies in the rat and monkey identified hematological, lymphoid, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal, and neurological toxicities of bortezomib. A steep dose-toxicity effect was noted at doses ≥0.9 mg/m2. Administration of doses ≥3.0 mg/m2 to monkeys resulted in cardiovascular collapse and death 12-14 h postdose. Histopathological evidence of axonal and myelin degeneration of dorsal root ganglia, peripheral nerves, and spinal cord were observed in monkeys and rodents; concurrent clinical observations included tremors and decreased activity. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with advanced malignancies demonstrated that the mean elimination half-life after the first bortezomib dose varied from 9 to 15 h at doses ranging from 1.45 to 2.00 mg/m2. The drug is metabolized by cytochrome P450-3A4, -2D6, -2C19, -2C9, and -1A2. Three Phase I studies were performed in a total of 123 patients with advanced malignancies. Dose-limiting toxicity included diarrhea and sensory neurotoxicity. No dose-limiting hematological toxicity was reported. Safety and efficacy were evaluated in an open-label, Phase II study of 202 patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least two prior therapies and had demonstrated disease progression on their most recent therapy. A smaller dose finding study of 54 patients provided additional supportive information. Bortezomib was administered by i.v. bolus on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day cycle for up to eight cycles. The initial dose was 1.3 mg/m2 except for 28 patients in the dose-finding study who received a 1.0 mg/m2 dose. The primary study end point in this single-arm trial was response rate, easily measured and thought to correlate with clinical benefit in patients with myeloma. One hundred eighty-eight patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in the FDA efficacy analysis population. Complete responses (CRs) were observed in 5 patients and partial responses (PRs) in 47 patients for an overall response (OR) rate (OR = CR + PR) of 28%. The dose finding study of 54 patients showed a higher response rate for patients given 1.3 mg/m2 compared with 1.0 mg/m2 twice weekly for two of the 3-week schedule, but the study was too small for statistical dose-response comparisons. The most commonly reported adverse events were asthenic conditions (including fatigue, malaise, and weakness) in 65%, nausea (64%), diarrhea (51%), appetite decreased (including anorexia; 43%), constipation (43%), thrombocytopenia (43%), peripheral neuropathy (37%, including peripheral sensory neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy aggravated), pyrexia (36%), vomiting (36%), and anemia (32%). Conclusions: The FDA granted marketing approval to Millennium Pharmaceuticals on May 13, 2003 for bortezomib for use as a single agent for the treatment of multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. Accelerated approval was based on a surrogate end point of response rate rather than clinical benefit, such as an improvement in survival. The recommended dose of bortezomib is 1.3 mg/m2 administered twice weekly for 2 weeks (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) followed by a 10-day rest period (days 12-21). Accelerated approval was based on the results of two Phase II studies in a total of 256 patients and additional Phase I safety information. Mandated Phase IV study commitments to characterize clinical efficacy and safety more precisely are discussed.","boronic acid derivative; bortezomib; anemia; anorexia; appetite disorder; arthralgia; article; asthenia; blood toxicity; cardiotoxicity; chemical analysis; clinical trial; constipation; demyelination; diarrhea; dose calculation; drug approval; drug efficacy; drug half life; drug manufacture; drug mechanism; drug metabolism; drug safety; drug structure; fatigue; fever; food and drug administration; gastrointestinal toxicity; headache; histopathology; human; immobilization; insomnia; leg pain; malaise; monkey; monotherapy; multiple myeloma; muscle weakness; nausea; nerve fiber degeneration; neurotoxicity; neutropenia; nonhuman; peripheral nerve; peripheral neuropathy; postmarketing surveillance; priority journal; rat; reduced physical activity; sensory neuropathy; spinal cord; spinal ganglion; thrombocytopenia; toxicokinetics; toxicology; tremor; vomiting; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Boronic Acids; Clinical Trials; Drug Approval; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Chemical; Multiple Myeloma; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Pyrazines; Time Factors; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration",,Article,Scopus

UCB is a hematopoietic tissue that contains a motherlode of cells, and creates the blood cells that carry oxygen, fight infections, and form clots at the sites of injuries. The use of UCB involves fewer ethical and legal problems than other stem cell technology. UCB banking not only involves the creation of a UCB storage bank, but is also a serial process that includes collecting UCB, extracting stem cells from UCB, storing these stem cells in liquid nitrogen at -385°F, and defrosting them if required by their owner. UCB banking service is thus a form of biological insurance, where the reward is an increased chance of good health rather than monetary compensation. Many people have begun to consider the need for public and private UCB banks to preserve cord blood donations. The main purpose of this research is to develop the UCB consumers' behavior based on the consumer buying behavior model. It clarifies the opinions of Taiwan people about UCB banking, identifies the main factors motivating people to store UCB, © MCB UP Limited.",,,Article,Scopus

Okra grown at a highly dense (HD) plant population of 25 x 23 cm and destructively harvested by machine was compared with control plants spaced at 90 x 23 cm and repeatedly and non-destructively harvested by hand. The control N fertilization regime was 45 kg·ha-1 of N preplant, followed by one or two topdressings, each with 22 kg·ha-1 of N. Treatments applied to HD plots were designed to be multiples of the control N fertilization levels. Preplant fertilizer was added such that the sum of residual soil N plus the added fertilizer would total to 45, 90, or 135 kg·ha-1 of N for the standard, intermediate, and highest rates, respectively. Topdressing rates were 22, 44, or 66 kg·ha-1 of N for standard, intermediate, and highest, respectively. Topdressing was timed to follow a mechanical harvest of the HD plots. Since there was only one mechanical harvest in the two 1995 studies, topdress N treatments did not affect yields from mechanical harvest in that year. Nitrogen treatments had few effects on fruit yield per hectare of HD okra, even when stem N concentrations equaled or exceeded those of control plants. The highest N rate tended to delay fruit production. Increasing N rates did not affect the marketable fruit yield obtained by mechanical harvest of HD plants expressed as a percentage of the total cumulative marketable fruit yield from control plants. Physiological factors appear to be limiting the potential for densely planted okra in a destructive mechanical harvest system rather than horticultural factors such as N nutrition.","Harvesting; Marketing; Nitrogen fertilizers; Plant cell culture; Population statistics; Mechanical okra; Plant populations; Plants (botany); Abelmoschus; Abelmoschus esculentus; Abelmoschus esculentus","American Society for Horticultural Science",Article,Scopus

An assessment of the competitiveness of vehicles using alternative powertrains has been made here. Previous studies estimating future costs and the technical performance of crucial powertrain components have been analyzed regarding both the results and the methods used. Contradictory results concerning future costs and performance in previous studies stem from the fact that they have used different methods and assumptions that answer different questions and reflect different levels of technical optimism. This assessment indicates that it is possible for all alternatives to attain both technical and economic competitiveness. However, the uncertainty and time scale associated with the alternatives differ substantially. Policy makers need not attempt to 'pick winners' from the alternative powertrains since demand-pull policy can be designed to benefit all alternatives and to be sensitive to the varying development status of key technologies.","Automobile manufacture; Competition; Cost accounting; Electric vehicles; Marketing; Technological forecasting; Battery powered; Cost assessment; Fuel cell vehicles; Hybrid vehicles; Powertrains; Automobile parts and equipment","Inderscience Publishers",Article,Scopus

THERATOPE® consists of the mucin antigen, sialyl-Tn (STn), a carbohydrate located on the surface of breast, colorectal and ovarian cancer cells, conjugated to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Merck KGaA has acquired a worldwide licence to THERATOPE® for treatment of breast cancer. Under the terms of the licence, Biomira and Merck KGaA, via its US affiliate, EMD Pharmaceuticals, will jointly market the vaccine in the US. Merck KGaA holds exclusive marketing rights for the rest of the world, except in Canada (where Biomira retains rights), Israel and the Palestine Autonomy Area. Merck KGaA is now collaborating on phase III development for breast cancer. Biomira stands to receive $US150 million in licence, milestone payments and equity investments. The development costs will be shared between the two companies in North America but Merck KGaA will be solely responsible for these costs in countries outside the US. Previously, Chiron Corporation had purchased a licence to THERATOPE® in 1997; however, Chiron terminated this agreement in June 2000. Under the terms of the termination, Biomira paid Chiron $US2.25 million to compensate the company for its investment in the development of THERATOPE®. In addition, Biomira will make another payment of $US3.25 million to Chiron upon FDA approval of the vaccine. No further payments or royalties will be made. In the third quarter of 2002, an independent review of interim data from the trial was conducted. This was the fifth scheduled review of the data by the Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), all of which produced a positive response. Following the completion of the review, the DSMB stated that the trial should continue and that it had no safety concerns regarding this trial. Although the data, to which Biomira and Merck KgaA are blinded, did not meet the predetermined statistical significance for either endpoint at the time of the review, both companies have chosen to continue with the trial. Biomira has since announced that the p-value for the interim survival analysis was set at 0.01, while it is set at 0.03 for final survival analysis. The tighter criteria was set for the interim analysis to potentially give the companies the opportunity of applying for marketing approval earlier than expected. Final analysis of the trial will take place in mid-2003. If these analyses indicate therapeutic efficacy, Biomira will meet the FDA and Canadian regulatory officials to obtain marketing approval for the vaccine for breast cancer under the accelerated review guidelines. Assuming a best-case scenario, the vaccine could be filed for approval in 2004. The phase III trial was initiated following positive preliminary results achieved in a bridging study in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the US and UK. Biomira announced final results of the bridging study in May 1999. The results confirmed that antibody titres against the STn antigen were significantly higher in patients treated with the improved formulation of THERATOPE®, compared with the corresponding titres of patients in the phase II trials of the old formulation of THERATOPE®. In September 2002, the first patient was enrolled in a phase II THERATOPE® trial, which is enrolling patients with metastatic breast cancer who are taking either an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant. Approximately 95 patients will be enrolled in the trial at up to 12 US sites. The study is primarily designed to evaluate THERATOPE®'s ability to induce an immune response in these patients. However, the safety and tolerability of the aromatase inhibitor plus THERATOPE®, and the fulvestrant plus THERATOPE® combinations will also be evaluated. The trial has not been designed to evaluate the efficacy of the two combinations. The US FDA has granted fast-track status to THERATOPE® for development as an adjunct to first-line combination chemotherapy in responding patients with metastatic breast cancer. A phase II trial in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer has been completed in the US; positive preliminary results from this trial were released in May 2001. On 24 November 1999, Biomira announced that it had licensed two patents covering methods of preventing growth of cancer cells expressing a mucin-type glycoprotein. The patents have been issued in the US and are pending in Japan and Canada. When issued in Japan, the patents will provide additional protection for THERATOPE® in that country. The patents were licensed from Dr Sen-itiroh Hakomori of the Biomembrane Institute in Seattle, with whom Biomira has also entered into a research collaboration. Biomira announced in April 2003 that following examination of its re-issue application by the US Patent and Trademark Office, its patent 5 798 090 was re-issued (RE 38 046) with additional claims. These additional claims represent broader patent coverage. The additional coverage will last until 2015. Earlier, in February 2000, Biomira announced an expansion of equity line for up to $US100 million; a 3-fold rise that was done without any additional shares of Biomira stock being issued. In June 2002, Biomira stated that it believes the market size for THERATOPE® in the US, Europe and Japan to be approximately 184 000 patients for the indication of metastatic breast cancer, of which the US would be 100 000, Europe 75 000 and Japan 9000. For the indication of colorectal cancer, the total market population for THERATOPE® is expected to be 183 000 patients, of which the US has been estimated at 100 000, Europe 75 000 and Japan 9000.","antineoplastic agent; aromatase inhibitor; cancer vaccine; cyclophosphamide; fluorouracil; folinic acid; fulvestrant; glycoprotein; mucin; raltitrexed; theratope; breast cancer; cancer growth; cancer survival; clinical trial; colon cancer; drug industry; drug marketing; drug safety; drug tolerability; dyspnea; female; flu like syndrome; human; hypoxia; immune response; immunostimulation; ovary cancer; patent; priority journal; review; statistical significance; stem cell transplantation","Adis International Ltd",Review,Scopus

The outcome and quality of life in approximately 60% of children with arthritis has been substantially improved as a result. The advent of biologics has been a further advance towards a new generation of novel therapies aimed at specific inflammatory molecules found to be relevant in different diseases.

Three of the systems include amotosalen [S 59] as the inactivation compound. Amotosalen is a light-activated, DNA-, RNA-crosslinking psoralen compound, which is used to neutralise pathogens. The systems that utilise amotosalen are called the INTERCEPT Platelet System, the INTERCEPT Plasma System and the Allogeneic Cellular Immunotherapies (ACIT) system. The INTERCEPT Platelet System and INTERCEPT Plasma System are two of the systems that make up Cerus' INTERCEPT Blood Systems. The other system is the INTERCEPT Red Blood Cell System, which contains S 303 as the inactivation compound rather than amotosalen. Cerus' Helinx technology is able to prevent replication of DNA or RNA that is present in pathogens but not in the blood components being treated (e.g. platelets and plasma). When added to the blood components, the inactivation agent (in this case amotosalen) crosses the membrane or cell wall of the pathogen. When activated by light, amotosalen binds to the nucleic acid of the pathogen and prevents replication. This process prevents infection. INTERCEPT Platelet System: Cerus developed its INTERCEPT Platelet System, in collaboration with Baxter Healthcare, for use in blood centres. Platelets are an essential component of the coagulation process and may be required by patients undergoing surgery, cancer chemotherapy, transplantation or with bleeding disorders. The system is made up of an illuminator device, a compound absorption device and a processing kit containing amotosalen. In October 2002, the two companies announced that CE Mark approval had been received for the illuminator device for the INTERCEPT trade mark Blood System. Application of this technology to platelets is the first to be approved. As it is a new technology, the system is currently undergoing process validation in accordance with European Blood Bank GMP requirements. This validation process is currently being conducted in Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden and the UK. Marketing approval applications for the INTERCEPT Platelet System have also been submitted in Australia and Canada. In addition, the regulatory submission process has begun in the US. A phase III trial (EuroSPRITE) has been conducted in 103 patients in Europe with pooled random donor platelets. The platelets were collected using the buffy coat process. Another two 20-patient clinical trials have also been conducted in Europe, as well as a 40-patient trial using platelets collected by an apheresis collection system. Cerus has also conducted a phase III trial (SPRINT) in the US. The trial was conducted in 671 patients and used platelets collected by Baxter's apheresis collection system. INTERCEPT Plasma System: Cerus is also developing the INTERCEPT Plasma System in collaboration with Baxter Healthcare. The system also combines amotosalen, an illumination device and a compound absorption device. The two companies are currently preparing regulatory applications for the INTERCEPT Plasma System for the US. This application will be followed by a submission for CE Mark designation in Europe. Patients undergoing surgery, or transplantation, or with bleeding disorders, may require transfusions of plasma, often to control bleeding. The type of plasma is stored in frozen form and is called fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The INTERCEPT Plasma System is currently in phase IIIc development in the US. Patient enrolment in the trial is still ongoing. The trial is comparing INTERCEPT trade mark Plasma System treated versus untreated FFP in 30 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Allogeneic Cellular Immunotherapies system: Cerus is also investigating the potential of its Helinx technology to improve the outcome of bone marrow transplantation procedures (used to treat leukaemia and lymphoma) through the treatmatment for many forms of leukaemia and is most effective when the donor is very closely matched to the patient for the major human leucocyte antigen (HLA) groups. As part of the transplant procedure, patients receive donor T cells to improve engraftment of the bone marrow transplant and strengthen the patient's immune system. However, donor T cells expose the patient to a high risk of contracting graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) caused by the proliferation of donor T cells, which attack the patient's healthy tissue. GVHD has a high mortality rate. Cerus' ACIT system has been developed to decrease the stringency of matching donors to patients and to inhibit the ability of donor T cells to cause GVHD. Light-activated amotosalen binds and permanently crosslinks DNA, preventing replication and thus stopping proliferation of donor T cells. Phase I development is currently being conducted in this area in the US using amotosalen as the neutralising agent. Cerus completed a phase I study investigating the safety and tolerability of its ACIT system in 2001. The study was conducted in patients receiving closely matched allogeneic bone marrow transplants for leukaemia. The company is currently collaborating with the National Marrow Donor Program in order to conduct further clinical studies in patients receiving bone marrow transplants from unmatched donors. Cerus has development, manufacturing and marketing agreements with Baxter covering the INTERCEPT Blood Systems, which includes the INTERCEPT Platelet system, the INTERCEPT Plasma System, and the INTERCEPT Red Blood Cell System. Under the terms of the agreements the two companies usually share the very early development activities. Cerus then conducts preclinical and clinical trials, while Baxter is responsible for the development of the systems disposables and devices. Following commercialisation Cerus will supply amotosalen and Baxter will supply the other components of the system and market, sell and distribute the system In January 2001, Cereus announced that it has entered into a collaborative agreement with the Pharmaceutical Division of Kirin Brewery in Japan to develop and market products for stem cell transplantation based on Cerus' proprietary Helinx technology. Under terms of the agreement, Cerus and Kirin will jointly develop the products. Cerus has received an initial license fee of US dollar 1 million. In addition it may receive up to US dollar 11 million in future payments upon achievement of development milestones. Kirin will also fund all development expenses for the Asia-Pacific region and a portion of Cerus' development activities aimed at obtaining product approval in the US. Kirin will market the products in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan, China, Korea and Australia, and Cerus will receive a specified share of product revenues. Cerus will retain marketing rights in the rest of the world, including the US and Europe.","antiinfective agent; cross linking reagent; DNA; immunosuppressive agent; psoralen derivative; S 59, psoralen; S-59, psoralen; article; clinical trial; drug delivery system; drug effect; human; instrumentation; methodology; thrombocyte transfusion; Anti-Infective Agents; Clinical Trials; Cross-Linking Reagents; DNA; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Platelet Transfusion; Psoralens; MLCS; MLOWN",,Article,Scopus

They are expressed in several cell types and, after activation by growth factor binding, trigger a series of intracellular pathways, leading to a wide variety of cell responses (e.g., differentiation, proliferation, migration and invasion, angiogenesis, survival). Over-expression and/or structural alteration of RTKs family members are often associated to human cancers and tumor cells are known to use RTK transduction pathways to achieve tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. Therefore, RTKs represent pivotal target in approaches of cancer therapy. A number of small molecules acting as RTK inhibitors have been synthesized by pharmaceutical companies and are under clinical trials, are being analyzed in animal models or have been successfully marketed. Ligand-dependent downregulation of RTKs is a critical step for modulating their activity and the adaptor Cbl has been indicated as the key protein involved in negative regulation of RTKs, such as EGF and HGF receptors.

It was therefore of interest to study how it influences the further development of the flowers once placed in water. An expansion of petal cells is central in growth of petals and thus opening of flowers. Among the processes involved are an increase in the osmotic pool, loosening and synthesis of cell wall components. In response to transient water stress a marked rise in the concentration of soluble sugars and reduction in starch has occurred in rose petals Rosa hybrida L. cv. Mercedes at the same time the growth of the flower was substantially inhibited. The rise in sugar content in rose petals was due to transport of sugars from the leaves to the flowers and to hydrolysis of starch within the petals. The contribution of the latter seems to be smaller by comparison. A similar study was conducted with wax flowers Chamelaucium unicatum. In response to transient water stress, A marked rise in soluble sugars coupled with marked enhancement of opening of the flowers has occurred. Fructans and starch are the source for the rise in soluble sugars. By inference we suggest that the difference between the flowers seem to stem from the effect transient waster stress may have on the processes occurring in the cell wall. It was hypothesized that in rose petals, loosening and synthesis of cell wall were negatively influenced by water stress, resulting in growth inhibition of the petals. In contrast, wax flowers that were introduced to culture from arid environment, are more immune to the adverse effect of transient water stress. Hence in response to water stress, osmotic adjustment occurs and in cooperation with cell expansion leads to growth stimulation of the petals. Transient water stress is an integral part of postharvest handling of cut flowers in the channels of marketing. The water transpired is replaced by air disrupting water column continuity and impeding water movement. Consequently water availability is reduced and hence turgor pressure is lowered. The question arise, will the flowers regain turgor pressure if replaced in water ? Will the flowers resume growth processes in the petals ? Does osmotic adjustment occurs and is it part of the recovery mechanism ? The driving force for water uptake is the difference in water potential, the osmotic potential in the plant cells is one of its components. It was estimated that in rose petals sugars are about 55% of the osmotic pool(Acock and Nichols 1979). Since photosynthetic activity is low in petals (Weiss et al., 1988), the petals depend on import carbon metabolites to support their growth. Starch is accumulating in petals and as it degrade it may serve as a source to supplement the osmotic pool, the maintenance of which is important in assuring a favorable water status. In response to water stress in plants, the concentration of a variety of common solutes, including sugars, organic acids and ions had been observed. This response however has not been adequately studied in petals. A cut flower provides an interesting plant model for studying the influence of stress in relation to tissue growth. First there are no roots to affect the osmotic adjustment to stress. Second, water stress can be quickly imposed and relieved. Third, growth is primarily restricted to the petals, that if were not exposed to stress would have undergone an intensive expansion processes. Note that growth of rose petals is primarily due to expansion of cells (Siegelman et al., 1958). Proc. VII Int.Symp. on Postharvest Physiology Ornamentals Eds. T.A.& D.G.Clark Acta Hort. 543, ISHS 2001 192 In the present study we demonstrated that in response to water stress a rise in soluble sugars has occurred. A reduction in the content of carbohydrate polymers has been measured. But the reduction in starch could not account for the rise in the sugar content. The rise in the content of sugars seem to derive from import from the adjacent leaves.",,"International Society for Horticultural Science",Article,Scopus

Some of these systems can deliver drugs continuously for over one year. However, little effort has been given to developing systems for the controlled release of nucleic acids. Recently, a novel gene transfer method which allows prolonged release and expression of plasmid DNA in vivo in normal adult animals was established. In this system, a biocompatible natural polymer such as collagen or its derivatives acts as the carrier for the delivery of DNA vectors. The biomaterial carrying the plasmid DNA was administered into animals and, once introduced, gradually released plasmid DNA in vivo. A single injection of plasmid DNA/biomaterial produced physiologically significant levels of gene-encoding proteins in the local/systemic circulation of animals and resulted in prolonged biological effects. These results suggest that the biomaterials carrying plasmid DNA may enhance the clinical potency of plasmid-based gene transfer, facilitating a more effective and long-term use of naked plasmid vectors for gene therapy. Furthermore, the biomaterials can be removed surgically, minimizing the effect of gene products if some unexpected side effects should be observed after application. The application of these systems to expand the bioavailability of molecular medicine, including antisense oligonucleotides and adenovirus vectors, and to aid in stem cell transplantation in the context of DNA-based tissue engineering will be discussed.","antisense oligonucleotide; atelocollagen; biomaterial; collagen; recombinant DNA; Adenovirus; animal; biotechnology; delayed release formulation; drug delivery system; drug implant; economics; financial management; gene therapy; gene transfer; gene vector; genetics; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; methodology; review; safety; Adenoviridae; Animals; Biocompatible Materials; Biotechnology; Collagen; Delayed-Action Preparations; DNA, Recombinant; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Implants; Gene Therapy; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genetic Vectors; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Marketing of Health Services; Oligonucleotides, Antisense; Safety",,Review,Scopus

Traditional efficacy outcomes in drug development for IBS include the ability of the compound to affect GI tract motility (i.e. to exert a prokinetic or an antispasmodic effect), which is thought to be of importance if a motor disorder is the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. More recently, altered visceral sensitivity to a distending stimulus has been suggested to be a key pathophysiological feature, at least in some patients, and has become a target for therapeutic interventions. However, there is now growing consensus that the primary outcome measure in the treatment of functional disorders are those that reflect overall control of the patient's symptoms (pain, diarrhoea, constipation) in everyday situations such as the clinical global improvement scales. Although, in general, guidelines on the design of treatment trials for functional GI tract disorders advise against subcategorisation of patients according to the main symptom (because of symptom instability), subcategorisation indeed makes sense especially in IBS (constipation- or diarrhoeapredominant). Compounds with a specific indication for each subpopulation of patients are now emerging. The rationale for investigations on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) receptor ligands in IBS rests mainly on the fact that serotonin, which may be released by enterochromaffin-like cells in the GI tract as well as from other sources, has a number of well documented motor effects on the GI tract and can produce hyperalgesia in several experimental models. Serotonin receptors belonging to the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 subtype are the most extensively studied in gastroenterology, although hitherto 'orphan' receptor subtypes, such as the 5-HT7 and the 5-HT1B/D receptors, are now emerging. Among 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, alosetron was recently approved for the treatment of diarrhoea-predominant IBS and is an example of a compound that, at least theoretically, may act at multiple levels: by inhibiting visceral sensitivity, by increasing compliance, and by inhibiting excitatory 5-HT3 receptors located on both ascending and descending neuronal pathways involved in peristalsis. For this reason, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may slow transit, hence the specific indication of alosetron in diarrhoea-predominant IBS. However, alosetron has been recently withdrawn by the manufacturer because of safety concerns. Hypomotility remains an attractive therapeutic target in IBS and the new generation of prokinetics includes several partial agonists at the 5-HT4 receptor, such as tegaserod (HTF-919) and prucalopride (R0-93877). In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that 5-HT4 receptors may also be involved in the modulation of visceral sensitivity. Second-generation 5-HT4 receptor agonists seem to be devoid of the QT-prolonging effects observed in some clinical circumstances with cisapride and may be more active at the colonic level. Piboserod (SB-207266A) is a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist under development for the treatment of diarrhoeapredominant IBS. Finally, interest in 5-HT7 and 5-HT1B/D receptor subtypes stems from the observation that the former receptors mediate smooth muscle relaxation (at least in the human colon), whereas sumatriptan (a 5-HT1B/D-receptor agonist) can affect GI tract motility and visceral sensitivity.","4 amino 5 chloro 2 methoxybenzoic acid 2 (1 piperidinyl)ethyl ester; 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 5 (1 indolylcarbonyl)benzimidazole; alosetron; alpha 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; antidiarrheal agent; azasetron; beta 3 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; brain derived neurotrophic factor; cilansetron; cisapride; dolasetron mesilate; fabesetron; granisetron; kappa opiate receptor agonist; loperamide; mosapride citrate; muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist; n methyl dextro aspartic acid; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor stimulating agent; n [4 methoxy 3 (4 methyl 1 piperazinyl)phenyl] 2' methyl 4' (5 methyl 1,2,4 oxadiazol 3 yl)[1,1' biphenyl] 4 carboxamide; neurotrophic factor; neurotrophin 3; ondansetron; piboserod; prucalopride; serotonin 1B agonist; serotonin 3 antagonist; serotonin 4 agonist; serotonin 4 antagonist; serotonin receptor; somatostatin derivative; sumatriptan; tachykinin receptor antagonist; tegaserod; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; abdominal pain; clinical feature; constipation; diarrhea; drug induced disease; gastrointestinal absorption; gastrointestinal motility; heart arrhythmia; human; irritable colon; pathophysiology; review","Adis International Ltd",Review,Scopus

In this study, we review the preclinical and clinical profiles of this immunoconjugate and the regulatory review that led to marketing approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Experimental Design: From the literature and manufacturer's data, we review the activity, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in preclinical and Phase I studies and its activity, efficacy, and side effects in three Phase 2 trials of 142 patients with relapsed AML. Results: In Phase I studies, the major toxicity was myelosuppression, especially neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, resulting from the expression of CD33 on myeloid progenitor cells. The Phase 2 dose was 9 mg/m2 infused i.v. over 4 h, repeated on day 14. A minority of patients experienced acute infusion-related symptoms, usually transient and occasionally requiring hospitalization. The complete response (CR) rate with full recovery of hematopoiesis was 16%. A subset of patients [CRs with incomplete platelet recovery (CRps)] was identified with blast clearance and neutrophil recovery but incomplete platelet recovery. The duration of responses of CRps appeared to be similar to those of the CRs, although the numbers were small. The question of the equivalence of these response groups was a central issue in the review of this new drug application (NDA). After considerable discussion, the Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee recommended allowing inclusion of CRps resulting in an overall response rate in the Phase 2 studies of 30%. In the subgroup of patients over 60 years of age, the overall response rate was 26%. Response duration was difficult to establish because of the high prevalence of postremission therapies. Tolerability and ease of administration may be improved compared with conventional chemotherapy, except for hepatotoxicity, with 31% of patients exhibiting abnormal liver enzymes. One patient died of liver failure in the Phase 2 trials. Conclusions: Marketing approval of gemtuzumab ozogamicin was granted on May 17, 2000 by the United States Food and Drug Administration under the Accelerated Approval regulations. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD33 positive AML in first relapse who are 60 years of age or older and who are not considered candidates for cytotoxic chemotherapy. The approved dose was 9 mg/m2 i.v. over 4 h and repeated in 14 days. Completion of the ongoing studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in relapsed AML and initiation of randomized clinical trials comparing the effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in combination with conventional induction chemotherapy to conventional chemotherapy alone on survival are mandated to confirm clinical benefit under the accelerated approval Subpart H regulations. Postmarketing reports of fatal anaphylaxis, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hepatotoxicity, especially venoocclusive disease (VOD) in patients treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin, with and without associated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), have required labeling revisions and the initiation of a registration surveillance program. Tumor lysis and ARDS have been reported in patients with leukocytes above 30, 000/ml treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin; therefore, the reduction of leukocyte counts to below 30, 000/ml is recommended prior to treatment. Patients should be carefully monitored for acute hypersensitivity, hypoxia, and delayed hepatotoxicity following treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin.","CD33 antigen; gemtuzumab ozogamicin; acute granulocytic leukemia; article; bone marrow suppression; cancer immunotherapy; cancer recurrence; chill; clinical trial; drug approval; drug efficacy; drug hypersensitivity; drug tolerability; fever; food and drug administration; human; liver toxicity; neutropenia; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; postmarketing surveillance; priority journal; rash; thrombocytopenia; vomiting; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aminoglycosides; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antineoplastic Agents; Clinical Trials; Female; Humans; Immunotoxins; Leukemia, Myelocytic, Acute; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Chemical; Recurrence; Time Factors; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration",,Article,Scopus

As not all centres have laboratories according to GMP standards for stem cell processing, sterile closed systems are desirable to prepare stem cells for deep-freezing, storage, thawing and transplantation. In addition, the certification procedure by the ""concerted action for stem cell transplantation"" has generated the need for standardising all procedures. Methods: In co-operation with MEDEVICE, Institute for Medical Device Marketing (Cologne, Germany) we developed procedures and products allowing to process and transplant stem cells in tailor made, single use medical devices. Two sets were investigated: Set No. 1 enables to connect all necessary reagents such as DMSO, HBSS, plasma, stem cell and storage bags to a closed system tubing set for the processing of stem cells under laminar flow bench. Set No. 2 is a specialised tubing set for the transplantation of stem cells. Results: Set No.1 allows easy and safe connections to all different sorts of media bottles, sample and infusion bags. Reagents can be mixed inside the system according to need before adding them to the cell suspension. Included filters (180μm) prevent that potentially available cell or fibrin aggregates can enter the tubing set. All parts are tested for DMSO stability. All components were tested for sterility. The total liquid-volume of the tubing set is about 2ml only. The set was tested with different blood cell components to assess cell loss which was found to be less than 5%. Set No. 2 enables flexibility in the connection of the wanted volume of stem cell bags and saline for transplantation. The transplantation kit was found to be of easy and safe handling while allowing enough flexibility to handle potential difficulties during transplantation. Conclusion: To our knowledge these are the first tailor made tubing sets for the processing and transplantation of stem cells currently being investigated in the routine application.",,,Article,Scopus

Priority was given to research on methods that act as a chemical or physical barrier to conception and to STDs including HIV; to menses inducers and once-per-month methods; and to male contraceptive methods. Much progress has been made since the 1996 report. This paper summarizes this progress. New research has been developed in the three priority areas, collaboration activities have been developed between the public and private sectors, and emergency contraception has been introduced to the US. Controversies are discussed in relation to immunocontraception, stem cell research and fetal tissue research. Finally there is a brief report on the lessons to be learned from the experience of the introduction of the implant, Norplant, in the US.

An examination of these issues is needed to inform public policy and to raise the awareness of prospective parents, clinicians, and investigators. Participants - Individuals with expertise in anthropology, blood banking, bone marrow transplantation, ethics, law, obstetrics, pediatrics, and the social sciences were invited to join the Working Group on Ethical Issues in Umbilical Cord Blood Banking. Evidence - Members were assigned topics to present to the Working Group. Following independent reviews, background materials were sent to the Working Group. Consensus Process - Individual presentations of topics at a 2-day meeting were followed by extensive group discussions in which consensus emerged. A writing committee then drafted a document that was circulated to the entire Working Group. After 3 rounds of comments over several months, all but 1 member of the Working Group agreed with the presentation of our conclusions. Conclusions - (1) Umbilical cord blood technology is promising although it has several investigational aspects; (2) during this investigational phase, secure linkage should be maintained of stored UCB to the identity of the donor; (3) UCB banking for autologous use is associated with even greater uncertainty than banking for allogeneic use; (4) marketing practices for UCB banking in the private sector need close attention; (5) more data are needed to ensure that recruitment for banking and use of UCB are equitable; and (6) the process of obtaining informed consent for collection of UCB should begin before labor and delivery.","article; autotransplantation; blood bank; blood donor; food and drug administration; informed consent; law; marketing; medical ethics; priority journal; stem cell transplantation; umbilical cord blood","American Medical Association",Article,Scopus

These results support the general thesis that the agent does not normally travel in the xylem stream. The movement of tobacco mosaic in tobacco and in tomato was found to be similar to that of aucuba mosaic. The majority of the experiments were carried out with aucuba mosaic in tomato. It was found that filtered virus juice from virus‐infected plants was readily absorbed at the cut end of a petiole and thence travelled into the xylem of the main stem. The removal of the treated petiole within 48 hours prevented infection taking place. On the other hand, when the petiole was left attached the experimental plant developed symptoms in the usual manner. This type of experiment was repeated with the exception that, after the removal of the treated petiole, the leaves above were crushed. Infection of the plant followed this treatment. This experiment was combined with the earlier experiments in which the living tissue of an internode was killed by steam. The agent was found to be carried mechanically in the xylem across the dead tissue. As a consequence of this observation the experiments with plants with “steamed” internodes were repeated. It was found that in no caw did crushing of the leaves induce symptoms on the upper part of the plant when inoculation had been made on the lower side of the “steamed” internode. It was concluded that the virus agent did not normally enter the water stream, and when it was introduced experimentally into it. though it was carried round, there was no mechanism by which it could leave the vessels. The absence of the agent from the hydathode exude was demonstrated. Apparently the agent cannot enter an unbroken cell, nor can it move through or out of dead cells. It has been found that great care must be taken to ensure the absence of traces of toxic substances from inocula to be tested, otherwise infection may not take place even in the presence of the agent itself. The rates of movement of the virus agent in the tomato are practically the same upward or downward. The slightly greater rate of upward movement appears to be associated with the greater metabolic activity which occurs in the upper portion of the plant. The movement of the virus agent along the protoplasmic strands has been examined by inoculating plants with infective juice after the removal of large portions of the vascular tissue. This treatment does not appear to delay the movement of the agent up the stem. In a final group of experiments, darkness did not appear to have any effect on the multiplication of the virus in the tissues. Too prolonged periods in the dark, however, caused the permanent wilting of both diseased and healthy plants. This “wilting” is considered us In‐mir due to the respiration of carbohydrates, etc., and the earlier collapse of the diseased plants as being due to a smaller carbohydrate supply in them.
